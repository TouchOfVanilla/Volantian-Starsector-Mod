Everything's gone to shit.

The gates collapsed. Chaos reigns. The Hypermedia sphere is abuzz with piracy, unrest, worlds falling... I didn't even bother with a communications blackout. The crew deserves to know what's going on, who they're fighting for... I offered them all a shuttle to their homeworlds, if they lived in the sector, but every single one of them stayed. I couldn't have been prouder of these fine people that keep the 130th running.

We mopped up the rebels pretty quickly, but our helljumpers took some pretty heavy losses. I can't expect we'll be getting more anytime soon. All we can do now is follow our orders- make it to the rendezvous point down south and hope that there's at least something there.

Sensors picked up a sizable fleet burning toward us a few hours ago. I'm preparing the fleet for combat.

We just need to make it to the rendezvous point.
