The rendezvous point is empty.

Bluesteel bastion is out of commission. What was once the headquarters of the battlegroup now sits in a decaying orbit around Kaizmera. The gate is still dead. Morale is in the pits, and we're low on fuel and supplies.

We need a new plan.

There's a cryosleeper in this system, and some derelict explorarium hulks we can break down. However, we can't get close to them without triggering their defense protocols- we're in for a fight. I don't care if I get court-martialed when the gates come back online.

Using all the supplies, equipment, and salvaged material from the sleeper and the drones, we should be able to bring Bluesteel back into working order, automate its systems, and throw most of the crew on ice to wait for the gates to open.

My name is Captain Julius Xavier of the 130th Legion of the Sixth Battlegroup, and I hereby acknowledge and plead guilty to my direct violation of the law.
