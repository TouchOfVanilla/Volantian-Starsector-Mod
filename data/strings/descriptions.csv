volantian_claymore_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Claymore is a large, heavy cruiser with a heavy ordinance suite to rival that of a Gryphon, and the hangar capacity to field a respectable fighter complement, and the tonnage needed to serve as the bulwark of a fleet detachment. While somewhat hindered by it's lower speed, the Claymore rarely needs to see the front line- but can weather it just as well.

Developed in the transitionary period into the Domain Armada ""Cruiser School"" era of ship design, the Claymore was an ambitious project intended to bridge the gap between the reliable strategic strike capabilities of strike craft and the quickly-growing popularity of cruisers in the Domain Armada Officer School. Acquired in a (usually) completely one-sided merger between Tri-Tachyon and a small startup known as Founder's Arms Aerotech, the hull was quickly pressed into corporate fleets after a few adjustments. Sensing their imminent unemployment, the forge technicians of the Claymore quickly installed a dead man's switch in the form of near-incomprehensible subsystem programming, ensuring their continued employment in Tri-Tachyon, but complicating subsystem function due to extended deployments in combat.",,,,
volantian_shamshir_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Featuring a surprisingly well-integrated phase skimmer, the Shamshir brings a terrifying amount of frontal firepower to a fleet engagement that can be repositioned in a near-instant. Following the extensive boardroom, under-the-table, and back-alley campaign to push the Paragon-Class Battleship past the Domain Naval Procurement Committee, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation sought to further solidify their role in the Domain Navy's naval contracting with a brand-new experimental hull- with an equally earnest (and shady) campaign to acquire the Odyssey-Class from Altair Exotech, following it's licensing to Epsilon-Eridani. However, the design never left the DNPC's testing phase, due to the collapse.

Many corporate operations managers claim that the Shamshir's hammer is best paired with the anvil of the Paragon- upon which many corporate enemies are broken.

Furthermore, leaked corporate documents suggest that the Shamshir's tactical role of slow, heavy firepower with burst movement potential was the main inspiration for the far more terrifying Radiant.",,,,
volantian_metatron_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The pinnacle of the Volantian frigate lineup, the Metatron-class frigate is a powerful force to have in any engagement- armed with several upscaled energy mounts and a temporal shell generator, it’s a wonder that this relatively tiny hull can fit enough crew to operate it effectively, let alone comfortably.

The Metatron was conceived (alongside their child) by two star-crossed lovers hailing from the VRI’s engineering division and Tri-Tachyon’s R&D team. Using the Hyperion as a template, the two worked day and night to create the perfect frigate. When the Metatron appeared in Tri-Tachyon intelligence reports, one had safely relocated the other to Volantis.

Despite its supreme firepower and tactical capabilities, the Metatron is rarely deployed in Volantian fleets due to its ability to eat through supplies at a rate that frequently puts it at a negative benefit/cost ratio. Nonetheless, officers that see its potential often pilot it themselves, despite its horrid crew accommodations. ",,,,
volantian_gauntlet_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

This unique overhaul of the Champion-class heavy cruiser is often viewed as a sidegrade to it’s inspiration- exchanging mounted firepower for a sophisticated, military-grade manufactory (with some components of it being classified for the next 187 years), and the hangar space to accomodate several fighter squadrons. The Gauntlet spares no expense in ensuring the swift and brutal eradication of it's enemies- much to the dismay of the quartermasters all over the sector tasked with fulfilling it's ravenous hunger for supplies.

The Champion's bloody legal history did not deter the Tri-Tachyon Corporation's ruthless corporate espionage, which played no small part in the company's acquisition of it's blueprints long before it even reached the Persean Sector. Initally, the blueprint was unusable, due to the ongoing legal battle between Altair Exotech and Orion Shipyards, but the collapse rendered any reverence against it's use null and void.

However, as with any technology procured by Tri-Tachyon, the Champion was immediately augmented with more high-tech components befitting of the corporation's fleet doctrine. However, seeing an opportunity for innovation, the newly-dubbed Gauntlet was used as the testing bed for a prototype fighter manufactory, converting the hull into a well-rounded battlecarrier.",,,,
volantian_curator_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Curator is the core of Volantian salvage fleets. Housing sophisticated sensor and survey equipment and a state-of-the-art salvage gantry, the Curator is the pinnacle of compact and cost effective exploration hulls. While its weaponry suite is lackluster for a ship of its size, the Curator can reliably fend off weaker threats, such as Domain Explorarium Derelicts or the odd pirate.

The Apogee-Class has always been the trademark of surveyor and scavenger fleets across the sector- after a copy of its blueprints was sourced (alongside many others) from the Maxios Charter polity in the Volantian lend-lease agreement, the Volantians quickly got to work stripping the hull of the more fragile and inefficient parts of the sensor suite, downgrading its weapon slots to house its internal salvage gantry, and cut down on its logistical profile.

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Quick and heavily armed, the Cordite is a devastating assault cruiser, capable of outgunning most opponents in a direct gunfight.

While the powerful large mount boosted by a High-Energy Focus system is exceptionally strong, the hull is otherwise slightly undergunned, with especially the available PD grid being heavily limited.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assault frigates.",,,,

A fast-attack high-tech light cruiser, the Fury is designed to choose when and where it strikes to inflict maximum effect upon the enemy. The specialized inbuilt plasma 'microburn' system allows the Fury to make small dashes at high speed to catch unwary opponents off-guard. ",,,,
volantian_radiant_vri,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after substituting the AI core housing with a rudimentary life support system and providing a generous application of teal paint.

The Radiant battleship was an outrageous blue-sky design created by some naval architecture unit given special indulgence by a Tri-Tach VP's bloated grandiosity. Both the official and existing unofficial histories of the First AI War never mention this class of ship ever being produced because an integrated phase skimmer could never be stable on a ship of such size. Surely it would explode into an infinity of curiously whorled short-lived child-dimensions upon initiation of the first skip. 

Nonetheless, here it is.",,,,
volantian_sandalphon_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Sandalphon-class frigate is somewhat of a stop-gap measure, cobbled together in the early days of the VRI. Designed for the sole purpose of chasing down wounded and retreating AI Remnant vessels, the Sandalphon features an integrated autopulse laser, a light and nimble frame, and an integrated temporal engine allowing for use of the ""Transfix Shift"" system for chasing down and flanking the fastest frigates, serving as a peerless hunter and performing lightning-fast maneuvers in the thick of battle.

In the dawn of the VRI, when resources were short and manpower was shorter, the Sandalphon was originally completely automated. In preparation for the political emergence of the Volantian polity on the grand scale of the sector, the design was quickly (barely) de-automated in compliance with the treaty of the First AI War. In the present day, the Sandalphon is widely employed in Volantian fleets and has been praised by fleet tacticians and condemned by engineers across the sector.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

A technologically advanced frigate with an efficient shield generator and an impressive weapons package that allows it to punch far above its weight. These same characteristics mean its frigate-grade power core struggles to keep up, making careful flux management a priority.",,,,
volantian_medusa_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

A fearsome ship whose top-tier engines provide great speed and maneuverability for a destroyer. Multiple energy weapon slots allow for a plethora of tactical possibilities. Its best-in-class performance is matched by a demanding logistical profile that has led some fleet commanders to eschew its use in favor of other ships that can be deployed more frequently and cheaply.

The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the sector due to its association with black ops and elite pirates. The few that have been aboard a Medusa can attest to its extreme level of technological sophistication. Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are some of the rarest and most closely guarded data in the Sector.

Deemed too expensive to mass produce by most corporations and governments, it is rarely employed by the lawful authorities as a black ops cruiser. On the rarest occasion, a Medusa-class hull may fall into the hands of pirates. The usual results are a drastic reduction in system small to medium shipping, which puts a strain on most planetary and outpost economies.

Sector naval tacticians have few answers for the threat that the Medusa presents.",,,,
volantian_lancet_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

A unique design hailing from Volantian fleets, the Lancet combines the speed of the Shrike-Class hull and the firepower of the Medusa-Class hull. A cruiser-grade power core and advanced targeting arrays allow the Lancet to punch far above its weight, only being hindered by its logistic profile.

The Lancet’s concept was originally perpetuated as a joke among senior officers in the VRI, only becoming an actual blueprint after an R&D request made in jest somehow made it all the way to finalization and production.",,,,
volantian_chromatic,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Chromatic is a relatively new pattern of remnant hull, only being officially documented after the second AI war. Its frontal-facing firepower and ability to overcharge its energy capacitors make it a terrifying threat to any fleet tactician. It is somewhat hindered by its relatively low top speed and lack of a phase skimmer, though.

The Chromatic has been specifically noted to be a threat to slower, heavily armored hulls like the Onslaught or the Dominator- however, due to its low maneuverability, it has trouble dealing with faster, more evasive vessels which can flank its relatively unprotected backside.",,,,

This modified segment of a Domain-Era cryosleeper (Sourced directly from Hypnos) is capable of hosting thousands of individuals in cryo-stasis. The Caelum is a strategic monster, able to transport the crew necessary to found colonies, or the marines needed to conquer worlds. Few vessels can hold a candle to the pure efficency of the Caelum.",,,,

The Kaleidoscope-class is a carrier which rivals the venerated Astral in its ability to project fighter superiority across an entire battlefield. While lacking any kind of auxillary weapon systems outside of point defense mounts, this slow capital is able to back entire ordos with it's anomalously efficent autofactories.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Karambit is a ship prized by smugglers and despised by patrol officers across the sector. This unique hull was devised by the VRI specifically for the purpose of smuggling- featuring a modified phase coil that allows for the hull to run a low-grade phase field which further reduces it's already minimal sensor profile. However, the Karambit is incapable of making a complete transition inti p-space.",,,,
volantian_lancet_lt,SHIP,"This particular variant of the Lancet-class features an experimental targeting core, completely overhauled subsystems, and ballistic mounts- suitable for long-range pressure and fire support.

This low-tech variant of the Lancet was quickly comissioned by the VRI's chief spymaster; after the inital mistake of it's creation was discovered and the junior officers were reprimanded, of course. It would become a part of a scheme to topple the Hegemony's entire espionage infrastructure in the VRI. Nowadays, this hull is routinely seen in Hegemony fleets. The amount of blood spilled, operatives lost, and hours of espionage work lost in exchange for this hull far outweights it's ironically small logistics profile. ",,,,
volantian_lancet_xiv,SHIP,"A survivor of the original 14th Domain Battlegroup which founded the Hegemony, this ship is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's 'decisive battle' doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical structural modifications performed using pre-Collapse industrial technology.

The Lancet and it's XIV variant was carefully painted as a hull comissioned in secret by Kali Molina, the soon-to-be first High Hegemon, before the collapse occured. Reports were then carefully fabricated to claim that the design had recently found it's way into Volantian posession. This fake intel was leaked to the entire VRI espionage network, it was only a matter of time before a Hegemony operative took the bait. The details of what followed are still classified for the next 800 cycles. ",,,,

This curious variant of the TTDS-pattern Lumen exists as a 'test' to see how easily the AI Remnants could be influenced by the VRI. After the carefully crafted blueprint was painstakingly planted into a Remnant nexus, the design soon spread across most Remnant-controlled systems in the sector, and further ""experiments"" of this nature have since been prohibited.

This experimental capital-class phase vessel boasts many unique technolgies and is impossibly rare- it's been speculated that less than 5 exist in the sector at any given time. It's unique Transfix Drive confounds many engineers and physicists with it's poorly understood inner workings- nonetheless, this drive allows the Paramerion to position itself terrifyingly fast- much to the detriment of any other vessel lacking in maneuverability.",,,,

Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after substituting the AI core housing with a rudimentary life support system and providing a generous application of teal paint.

Typical of high-end TriTachyon products, the Brilliant-class cruiser spares no excess in mounting the most advanced suite of energy weaponry possible - as well as a small but fully capable fighter bay. Having undergone an extensive refit to house human crew, this particular variant of the Brilliant is incredibly versatile and can fit almost any role in a fleet.",,,,

volantian_claymore,SHIP,"The Claymore is somewhat of a black sheep in the high tech school of design- possessing remarkably low-tech components, two large missile mounts, and easily sourced parts (from remnant derelicts and scrapyards alike), this ship is often prized for its cheap availability, and scorned for its brutal, almost barbaric efficiency. Nonetheless, it is quite effective in battle and can deliver surprising amounts of ordinance at any given moment- if the battle lasts long enough for it to lumber into range.",,,,
volantian_gauntlet,SHIP,"This unique retrofit of the Champion-class heavy cruiser is often viewed as a sidegrade to it’s inspiration- taking a page out of the Domain-Era “Cruiser School” doctrine pioneered by Altair Exotech, the Gauntlet-Class cruiser sacrifices mounted firepower for a sophisticated, military-grade manufactory (with some components of it being classified for the next 187 years), and several fighter bays. Despite it's demanding logistics profile, this hull sees limited use in mercenary fleets as well as Tri-Tachyon Patrols.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Cressida is a smaller-sized vessel that utilizes the same principles as the Doom-Class Cruiser to lay mines, while doing so safely with the use of it's phase cloak. It has decent armor for a phase ship, allowing it to spend more time in harm's way delivering heavy ordinance.

At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Prismatic-Class destroyer is a nimble, terrifying vessel that has only appeared quite recently in remnant fleets. Many reports detail its striking tactical similarity to the Sunder-Class destroyer, featuring heavy frontal firepower, a somewhat limited PD suite, and a fragile hull. However, several notable improvements, in the form of a fighter bay, mount versatility, and an improved shield emitter makes for a truly formidable destroyer. In the hands of an AI core, the phrase 'glass cannon' comes to mind.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Naegling is an ambitious design that initally saw use during the Volantian Imperial era, against the Luddic Church in the early cycles after the collapse. Fleet admirals cited the Naegling's heavy fighter complement and ample point defense net as a saving grace against the Church's overwhelming numbers of strike craft. However, the hull also sports an above-average weapons suite that has earned it the title of a battlecarrier.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Often called the Eagle cruiser's little brother, the Falcon-class cruiser sacrifices armor for speed, neatly filling the light cruiser role in military fleets throughout the Sector. 

The ""light"" designation does not indicate a significant reduction in firepower, however, making the Falcon a valuable tactical asset to any fleet. The ship is easily able to fill a wide variety of roles, from close support to assault, given the proper configuration. 

The Falcon's top notch engines give it the ability to quickly disengage from battle should its defenses be pressed to a critical point.

Swift and elegant, Falcon-class cruisers are often found as lead elements in larger fleet formations, or deployed to reinforce anti-pirate convoys.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Taking note of the rapidly changing situation in the Persean Sector, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation investigated an alternative to the Venture that could deal with the new chaotic realities they found themselves in. The culmination of this research was the Hippocampus, a modification of the Gemini with improved flux systems, a conversion to a more flexible weapons and flight deck loadout, and the inclusion of a very sophisticated range of photometric scanners, deep-terrain sensors and atmosphere characterisation equipment that drastically reduces the workload cost required to carry out a survey. The cost of the 'Hippo's attractive capabilities is a drastic loss in cargo space and relatively high logistical profile, requiring a sizeable investment in support vessels to support it.",,,,

Originally a high-tech, nimble shuttle focused on after-battle ship repair, the Remora has been converted into a combination salvage and survey ship to rival the Shepherd. The repair drones have been altered to not only acquire space-borne scrap, but also deliver a steady EMP disruption to targets. These drones are incredibly effective at disabling smaller targets, and harassing larger ships, however their weapons lack the missile targetting algorithms, making them pointless point defense escorts.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Possibly the largest (known) vessel with a phase skimmer, the Ionos-class is a comparatively undergunned and logisitically expensive battlecruiser. However, with the superior mobility afforded by its skimmer system combined with capital-grade flux systems, the Ionos is a surprisingly nimble and dangerous foe to face.

The Ionos-class is a vessel shrouded in mystery. Its development at first appeared to be a straightforward improvement on a relatively new Domain Navy design from before the collapse. Over time, its developmental histroy got increasingly hazy and unclear, until the First AI War, wherein the class's development history vanishes completely from known records. Recently the ship has been spotted in Tri-Tachyon fleets, although its rarity has prevented a full examination of the differences from the old design. In fact, some Hegemony analysts consider the current day Ionos a completely different design from the original in development before the War, and only keep the hull's classification for simplicity.

The Ionos is, theoretically, the largest vessel that can safely utilise a phase skimmer without disappearing into phase space or suffer long term effects on crew. It is primarily because of the oversized skimmer device that the vessel is so disproporitonately expensive to maintain.",,,,

daedalus_station,CUSTOM,"A shattered astropolis of the former Volantian Empire. Mostly dead and derelict, with most useful materials being stripped or destroyed long ago.",,,,
vri_planet_tally,CUSTOM,"A mostly unremarkable cryovolcanic world. The presence of ruins and the abundance of resources has earned the attention of the VSB, and countless techmining and salvage missions have been conducted on its surface, but no formal action has been taken yet.",,,,
vri_planet_Eminence,CUSTOM,"Eminence was a rebel colony world in the days shortly before the collapse. Few records remain of its existence, and fewer with any context as to who these rebels were. By the time the planet was rediscovered post-collapse, it seems the inhabitants had fallen into civil conflict which ended in a nuclear exchange, wiping out every human on the planet. By all logic and known examples, Eminence should be an uninhabitable wasteland, but it has made a miraculous recovery. The local flora and fauna have adapted remarkably well to the ambient radiation. The planet is a lush green from orbit, cities are coated in plants after being reclaimed by nature, large herds of animals roam the fields, and the skies are filled with beautiful auroras. Eminence is a prime location for resettlement, so long as its colonists keep a healthy diet of antirad medication. However, in it’s present state, the VRI is unable to colonize it due to the sheer industrial undertaking of shielding an entire colony from radiation.",,,,
vri_planet_Volantis,CUSTOM,"Volantis is the namesake, military backbone, and pride of the Volantian Reclamation Initiative, and a paradise for those rejected by the core worlds, newly-awakened cryosleepers, and dreamers all across the sector. Accordingly, the planet is famous (or infamous, depending on religion) as a paradise for the Genemodded and Cybernetically enhanced citizens of the Persean Sector shunned by the Luddic Church and Hegemony.",,"From orbit, the lights of the countless cities and population centers make a perfectly organized pattern, hinting at the planet’s almost inhuman efficiency. Reflecting the planet's importance, the planetary administration has enacted a policy of zero pollution, though increasing Hegemony pressure and ever-increasing need for military hardware is likely to change that.

vri_planet_Desmond,CUSTOM,"Desmond’s Landing is the steadily growing industrial center of the VRI; buried miles underneath of the tectonically-stable crust of the barren world lies a complicated tunnel network. Hab-complexes, industrial districts, artificial ecosystems, and other components of interplanetary inhabitation all rest comfortably beneath several meters of lead plating. Originally sought after due to it’s rich ore deposits, Desmond’s Landing has become a remarkably thriving and bustling population and industrial center.",,"The surface is unusually devoid of light, with infrastructure only diverging from the deep crust to provide entryway for commercial and military spacecraft. An automated transmission gives you the locations of various docking points scattered about the surface of the planet. The transmission also gives info on scheduling a time to request the heavy lead shielding to be retracted, so your fleet may dock.",,
vri_SubA1,CUSTOM,"Sublimation Platform A1 is a massive siphon station orbiting around Okeanos. Dubbed “Spay-1” by the locals that operate the advanced siphoning systems, it constantly extracts volatiles from the surface of Okeanos and exports it to Volantian fuel plants. Originally, Sublimation Platform A1 was the grounds for an hypothetical automated volatile collection platform. This was quickly put on indefinite suspension due to budget concerns and uncooperative AI. Thus, Sublimation Platform A1 was relegated to use as a population center and a volatiles siphoning station, albeit a manual one. Each and every individual level of the station is perfectly constructed and laid out in an incredibly efficient manner.",,"As you approach the station, an automated message reminds you to not approach Okeanos, or interfere with the service, maintenance, or collection drones that dart about the station. They’re all painted teal, and their transponders clearly identify that they are all, infact, drones, and they will not adjust heading for you or your fleet. A set of navigational buoys guides you towards one of the station’s many docking platforms.",,
vri_planet_Geir,CUSTOM,"A shining example of post-collapse terraforming efforts and technology, Geir’s Slab was a planet sought after by the Eridani-Utopia terraforming corporation in the pre-collapse era for the sheer abundance of ice in its upper crust. However, interest in the planet was quickly lost after it was discovered that its orbit around Okeanos dragged the planet through one of the dust rings of the star system, subjecting the surface to seasonal orbital bombardment severe enough to make any colonization effort grueling at best. Hundreds of cycles later, the newly-formed Volantian Reclamation Initiative saw unique potential in Geir’s Slab. With the use of their global artillery network “Aegis,” the planet is now protected from the seasonal meteor showers, with a 95.3% coverage rate. Terraforming efforts are slow, and the temperatures remain quite harsh, but to quote the planetary administration: “It gets a little greener every year.”",,"As your fleet enters orbit, you watch the Aegis system hard at work, with the occasional streak of durasteel slugs accelerated at frightening speeds impacting on unseen asteroids and celestial bodies as they approach the planet. An automated broadcast from the net of navigational and telemetry buoys around the planet reminds you to keep your transponder on, lest you are mistaken for a meteorite.",,
vri_Nocturne,CUSTOM,"Nocturne Station is viewed by many as the eternal shield of the Uelyst system, one of the best officer schools of the entire sector, one of the largest garrisons of the VAF, and a gutted-out remnant station. With most autonomous infrastructure being removed and repurposed for more useful matters like life support and housing, Nocturne Station attracted the attention of the VAF for the abundance of military hardware already integrally present in the station- with some relatively minor adjustments, the same autofactories that churned out legions of cyan droneships now bolster the ranks of the Volantian Fleet with it’s almost unparalleled industrial might.",,"You’re not used to being this close to a remnant nexus without seeing it through a web of targeting solutions. Your crew shares your caution- the bridge is dead silent as you pass by the radiation-scarred armor plating and the dormant weapons pods that bristle on every side of the station. After what feels like an eternity, you finally pull into one of the many hangar docks that have been carved into the station.",,
vri_Stalos,CUSTOM,"Stalos Outpost is an automated drone nexus that was converted into an industrial and militarized habitat, much like Nocturne. However, Stalos Outpost is devoted to being the headquarters of the Volantian Salvage Bureau. Dockyards and supply depots pepper the station, which serves as the staging grounds for salvage, research, and survey operations to Tally and Eminence. Initially, Stalos outpost was a dull and quiet frontier outpost- however, with the arrival of the VSB, the station is emboldened with new spirit as hopeful and curious flock to the station in hopes of finding ancient treasures.",,"You’re not used to being this close to a remnant nexus without seeing it through a web of targeting solutions.

vri,FACTION,"The Volantian Reclamation Initiative is the relatively new scion of the fallen Volantian Empire, a long-dead polity that traces its origins back to the first sporeships that reached the Persean Sector, long before the reign of the Domain of Man. The VRI slowly reclaims the husk of their former empire, rapidly growing into a power of the sector and restoring their former heritage. Their liberal use of barely-legal AI and “unsanctioned” privateering and raiding has created several enemies- which the VAF works valiantly to keep at bay-but their openness to trade and collaborate have earned them a sizeable backing from the other polities of the Persean Sector.",,,,
