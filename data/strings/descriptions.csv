volantian_claymore_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Claymore is somewhat of a black sheep in the high tech school of design- possessing remarkably low-tech components, two large missile mounts, and easily sourced parts (from remnant derelicts and scrapyards alike), this ship is often prized for its cheap availability, and scorned for its brutal, almost barbaric efficiency. Nonetheless, it is quite effective in battle and can deliver surprising amounts of ordinance at any given moment- if the battle lasts long enough for it to lumber into range.",,,,
volantian_shamshir_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.Possessing a phase skimmer, a debilitatingly low top speed, and a vast amount of frontal firepower, the Shamshir is a menace to any officer unlucky enough to be staring it in the bow. Many fleet tacticians treat a Shamshir’s presence not unlike a Radiant, due to its ability to quickly turn and reposition itself with its integrated phase skimmer, which (somehow) is tailored for the vessel’s sheer size.",,,,
volantian_metatron_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The pinnacle of the Volantian frigate lineup, the Metatron-class frigate is a powerful force to have in any engagement- armed with several upscaled energy mounts, a temporal shell generator, and powerful remnant engines to boot, it’s a wonder that this relatively tiny hull can fit enough crew to operate it effectively, let alone comfortably.The Metatron was conceived (alongside their child) by two star-crossed lovers hailing from the VRI’s engineering division and Tri-Tachyon’s R&D team. Using the Hyperion as a template, the two worked day and night to create the perfect frigate. When the Metatron appeared in Tri-Tachyon intelligence reports, one had safely relocated the other to Volantis.Despite its supreme firepower and tactical capabilities, the Metatron is rarely deployed in Volantian fleets due to its ability to eat through supplies at a rate that frequently puts it at a negative benefit/cost ratio. Nonetheless, officers that see its potential often pilot it themselves, despite its horrid crew accommodations. ",,,,
volantian_gauntlet_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.This unique retrofit of the Champion-class heavy cruiser is often viewed as a sidegrade to it’s inspiration- taking a page out of the Domain-Era “Cruiser School” doctrine pioneered by Altair Exotech, the Gauntlet-Class cruiser sacrifices mounted firepower for a sophisticated, military-grade manufactory (with some components of it being classified for the next 187 years), and several fighter bays. Despite it's demanding logistics profile, this hull sees limited use in mercenary fleets as well as Tri-Tachyon Patrols.",,,,
volantian_flagellator_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Volantian Engineering Devision created this retrofitted version of the Flagellator-Class destroyer, likely due to the steady stream of these hulls brought in by salvage teams from skirmishes with the Hegemony. It features an improved power and flux grid in return for it's original crusher drive. Nonetheless, it remains a terrifying hunter-killer asset in Volantian patrols.",,,,
volantian_indomitable_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.This unique hull is a complete technological overhaul of the EIS Indomitable-Class Cruiser. The VRI acquired it's blueprint in a shady, backroom deal with unknown third parties. A slower, harder-hitting version of it's former self, this Indomitable variant is a well-placed fleet anchor with plenty of firepower at it's disposal, much to the dismay of Iron Shell officers and generals. ",,,,
volantian_courageous_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The EIS Courageous-Class Frigate was an interesting proposal to the VRI. Volantian engineers, upon acquiring it's blueprints, opted to instead rotate the hull 180 degrees and increase it's mobility and flux capabilites. The built-in gunblades have been entirely removed, and the ship is much more maneuverable. It's a frequent topic of discussion in IS FLEETCOM, and has triggered relentless security improvements in the Iron Shell and Hegemony alike.",,,,
volantian_curator_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Curator is the core of Volantian salvage fleets. Housing sophisticated sensor and survey equipment and a state-of-the-art salvage gantry, the Curator is the pinnacle of compact and cost effective exploration hulls. It's armaments and power grid are enough to deter pirates and remnants alike.",,,,
volantian_cordite_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.Quick and heavily armed, the Cordite is a devastating assault cruiser, capable of outgunning most opponents in a direct gunfight.While the powerful large mount boosted by a High-Energy Focus system is exceptionally strong, the hull is otherwise slightly undergunned, with especially the available PD grid being heavily limited.",,,,
volantian_rapture_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Rapture is a terrifying tide-turner of any battle. Able to conjure a powerful EMP pulse (without breaking itself apart,) the Rapture is able to take down even the largest of capital vessels- with help.",,,,
volantian_sunder_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assault frigates.",,,,
volantian_fury_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.A fast-attack high-tech light cruiser, the Fury is designed to choose when and where it strikes to inflict maximum effect upon the enemy. The specialized inbuilt plasma 'microburn' system allows the Fury to make small dashes at high speed to catch unwary opponents off-guard. ",,,,
volantian_radiant_vri,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after removing the AI core housing and providing generous application of teal paint.The Radiant battleship was an outrageous blue-sky design created by some naval architecture unit given special indulgence by a Tri-Tach VP's bloated grandiosity. Both the official and existing unofficial histories of the First AI War never mention this class of ship ever being produced because an integrated phase skimmer could never be stable on a ship of such size. Surely it would explode into an infinity of curiously whorled short-lived child-dimensions upon initiation of the first skip. Nonetheless, here it is.",,,,
volantian_kite_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This compact space/aircraft is streamlined for efficient atmospheric flight and boasts a grid of cleverly distributed short-burst maneuvering thrusters coordinated by a delta-level AI subsystem to ensure smooth landings (a point driven home by Fabrique marketing by way of amusing ad-holos featuring a well-dressed couple and an overfull wine glass). The Kite has powerful engines for a civilian ship of its size, though zero-G maneuverability leaves something to be desired when the special subsystem is not engaged. In the dangerous cycles post-Collapse, the Kite has been outfitted with a defense turret in place of the executive-class viewing dome and the two auxiliary jet-pods are replaced with missile systems (which do not need to draw on the limited powerplant). It won't stand up in a fair fight, but the Kite can be given unexpectedly sharp teeth and use its speed to escape from raiders. Luddic Path radicals have even been known to use modified Kite to deliver strike weapons against helpless freighters, followed by engaging the maneuvering subsystem to make a swift exit to avoid the wrath of their victim's escort. ",,,,
volantian_sandalphon_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Sandalphon-class frigate is a heretical abomination in the eyes of any engineer. Designed for the sole purpose of chasing down wounded and retreating AI Remnant vessels in the early days of the VRI, the Sandalphon features an integrated autopulse laser, a light and nimble frame, and an integrated phase skimmer for chasing down and flanking the fastest frigates.In the present day, this unique frigate serves as a peerless hunter and performs lightning-fast maneuvers in the thick of battle. The Sandalphon is widely employed in Volantian fleets and has been praised by fleet tacticians and condemned by engineers across the sector.",,,,
volantian_wolf_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.A technologically advanced frigate with an efficient shield generator and an impressive weapons package that allows it to punch far above its weight. These same characteristics mean its frigate-grade power core struggles to keep up, making careful flux management a priority.",,,,
volantian_shepherd_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Ko Combine r450 ""Shepherd"" sets the standard for civilian drone tenders with unmatched reliability, low cost, and internal volume given to crew comfort. A wildly popular combat modification package has been assembled by various survivalist and pirate groups, the ""HK"" mod, which consists of specifications to up-armour the hull for combat and supercharge factory-spec systems for greater burst speed and weapon function. Even modified, the Shepherd is fragile, so as in civilian life it relies on a swarm of “Borer” utility drones to do its work.The ""Borer"" is built on a hardy, maneuverable semi-autonomous drone chassis with shielding suitable for hazardous operations in which high radiation or physical impacts may be expected. Commonly used in mining applications, they have also found use in salvage, ordnance disposal, and even fission meltdown clean-up. The HK mod package gives specifications for altering the primary cutting beam's focus and patches the rudimentary AI with crude tactical algorithms pirated from obsolete Domain Colonial Garrison drone software. Appendices of the mod package recommend caution when employing HK-modified drones in non-combat situations.",,,,
volantian_medusa_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.A fearsome ship whose top-tier engines provide great speed and maneuverability for a destroyer. Multiple energy weapon slots allow for a plethora of tactical possibilities. Its best-in-class performance is matched by a demanding logistical profile that has led some fleet commanders to eschew its use in favor of other ships that can be deployed more frequently and cheaply.The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the sector due to its association with black ops and elite pirates. The few that have been aboard a Medusa can attest to its extreme level of technological sophistication. Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are some of the rarest and most closely guarded data in the Sector.Deemed too expensive to mass produce by most corporations and governments, it is rarely employed by the lawful authorities as a black ops cruiser. On the rarest occasion, a Medusa-class hull may fall into the hands of pirates. The usual results are a drastic reduction in system small to medium shipping, which puts a strain on most planetary and outpost economies.Sector naval tacticians have few answers for the threat that the Medusa presents.",,,,
volantian_lancet_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.A unique design hailing from Volantian fleets, the Lancet combines the speed of the Shrike-Class hull and the firepower of the Medusa-Class hull. A cruiser-grade power core and advanced targeting arrays allow the Lancet to punch far above its weight, only being hindered by its logistic profile.The Lancet’s concept was originally perpetuated as a joke among senior officers in the VRI, only becoming an actual blueprint after an R&D request made in jest somehow made it all the way to finalization and production.",,,,
volantian_chromatic,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.The Chromatic is a relatively new pattern of remnant hulls, only being officially documented after the second AI war. Its frontal-facing firepower and ability to overcharge its energy capacitors make it a terrifying threat to any fleet tactician. It is somewhat hindered by its relatively low top speed and lack of a phase skimmer, though.The Chromatic has been specifically noted to be a threat to slower, heavily armored hulls like the Onslaught or the Dominator- however, due to its low maneuverability, it has trouble dealing with faster, more evasive vessels which can flank its relatively unprotected backside.",,,,
volantian_chromatic_vri,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after removing the AI core housing and providing generous application of teal paint.After its blueprint was acquired through unknown means, the VRI quickly went to work hacking it to completely retrofit the Chromatic to fit human crew, shore up its point-defense capabilities, and make it legal by Hegemony standards, to avoid sparking the next AI war.",,,,
volantian_caelum_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.This modified segment of a domain-era cryosleeper (Sourced directly from Hypnos) is capable of hosting thousands of individual crew members. The Caelum-class hull has seen many missions, mostly to colonization canidate worlds, decivilized worlds, and core world raids.",,,,
volantian_kaiken,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.The Kaiken-class pattern of remnant hulls was documented at the same time as the Chromatic-class- many theorize that the hulls were meant to complement each other, due to the Kaiken's specialization on fighters and point defense, while the Chromatic severely lacks on both fronts.",,,,
volantian_kaiken_vri,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after removing the AI core housing and providing generous application of teal paint.<<<<<<< HEADAfter its blueprint was acquired through unknown means, the VRI quickly went to work hacking it to completely retrofit the Kaiken to fit human crew, shore up its point-defense capabilities, increase it's armor rating, and make it legal by Hegemony standards, to avoid sparking the next AI war.",,,,
volatian_karambit_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Karambit is a ship prized by smugglers and despised by patrol officers across the sector. This unique hull was devised by the VRI specifically for the purpose of smuggling- featuring a modified phase coil that allows for the hull to run a low-grade phase field which further reduces it's already minimal sensor profile. ",,,,
volantian_lancet_lt,SHIP,"This low-tech variant of the Lancet was quickly comissioned by the VRI's chief spymaster; after the inital mistake of it's creation was discovered and the junior officers were reprimanded, of course. It would become a part of a scheme to topple the Hegemony's entire espionage infrastructure in the VRI. Nowadays, this hull is routinely seen in Hegemony fleets. The amount of blood spilled, operatives lost, and hours of espionage work lost in exchange for this hull far outweights it's ironically small logistics profile. ",,,,
volantian_lancet_xiv,SHIP,"A survivor of the original 14th Domain Battlegroup which founded the Hegemony, this ship is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's 'decisive battle' doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical structural modifications performed using pre-Collapse industrial technology.The Lancet and it's XIV variant was carefully painted as a hull comissioned in secret by Kali Molina, the soon-to-be first High Hegemon, before the collapse occured. Reports were then carefully fabricated to claim that the design had recently found it's way into Volantian posession. This fake intel was leaked to the entire VRI espionage network, it was only a matter of time before a Hegemony operative took the bait. The details of what followed are still classified for the next 800 cycles. ",,,,
volantian_lumen_xiv,SHIP,"A survivor of the original 14th Domain Battlegroup which founded the Hegemony, this ship is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's 'decisive battle' doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical structural modifications performed using pre-Collapse industrial technology.This curious variant of the TTDS-pattern Lumen exists as a 'test' to see how easily the AI Remnants could be influenced by the VRI. After the carefully crafted blueprint was painstakingly planted into a Remnant nexus, the design soon spread across most Remnant-controlled systems in the sector, and further ""experiments"" of this nature have since been prohibited. ",,,,
volantian_phaeton_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.A medium tanker with enough fuel capacity to support a larger fleet. Tanker duty is often considered punitive in the Hegemony - there's little opportunity for distinction, and less chance of survival should direct contact with the enemy occur.",,,,
volantian_mora_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.Due to the sheer availibility of the Mora-Class carrier throughout the sector, Volantian Engineers saw it necessary to create a standardized hull conversion including an upgraded power core, greater flux capacity, and weapon mount refits.",,,,
volantian_paramerion_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.This experimental capital-class phase vessel hosts many unique technolgies and is impossibly rare- it's been speculated that less than 5 exist in the sector at any given time. It's unique Transfix Drive confounds many engineers and physicists with it's poorly understood inner workings- nonetheless, this drive allows the Paramerion to position itself terrifyingly fast- much to the detriment of any other vessel lacking in maneuverability.",,,,
volantian_incursor_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Incursor-class Freighter Carrier was born from the VRI's smuggling and trade fleet's need for fighter support without sacrificing cargo capacity.",,,,
volantian_fulgent_lt,SHIP,"This pattern of Fulgent-class Remnant hulls appeared after the VRI's initial experiment with the Fourteenth Battlegroup Lumen, completely unprompted and without exterior manipulation. ",,,,
volantian_glimmer_vri,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after removing the AI core housing and providing generous application of teal paint.Typical of high-end TriTachyon products, the Brilliant-class cruiser spares no excess in mounting the most advanced suite of energy weaponry possible - as well as a small but fully capable fighter bay considered essential to facilitate inspection tours by potential buyers. Having undergone an extensive refit to house human crew, this particular variant of the Brilliant is incredibly versatile and can fit almost any role in a fleet.",,,,
volantian_brilliant_vri,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after removing the AI core housing and providing generous application of teal paint.The Glimmer provides long-range support fire from its array of energy weapons, keeping up flux-pressure on opposing forces.",,,,
volantian_claymore,SHIP,"The Claymore is somewhat of a black sheep in the high tech school of design- possessing remarkably low-tech components, two large missile mounts, and easily sourced parts (from remnant derelicts and scrapyards alike), this ship is often prized for its cheap availability, and scorned for its brutal, almost barbaric efficiency. Nonetheless, it is quite effective in battle and can deliver surprising amounts of ordinance at any given moment- if the battle lasts long enough for it to lumber into range.",,,,

Despite it's demanding logistics profile, this hull sees limited use in mercenary fleets as well as Tri-Tachyon Patrols.",,,,
volantian_cressida_vri,SHIP,"Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving its performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.The Cressida is a smaller-sized vessel that utilizes the same principles as the Doom-Class Cruiser to lay mines, while doing so safely with the use of it's phase cloak. It has decent armor for a phase ship, allowing it to spend more time in harm's way delivering heavy ordinance. Many of the psychological issues regarding phase ships are somewhat reduced, given the Cressida's finely-tuned phase coils and somewhat generous crew amenities.",,,,

volantian_rapturepulse,SHIP_SYSTEM,"After a brief chargeup, unleashes a massive EMP pulse that overloads every enemy ship in range.",,,,
,,,,,,
vol_clovercannon,WEAPON,"Contrary to popular belief, instead of projecting bolts of plasma or energy, the Clover Cannon actually accelerates temporally-excited magnesium shells toward it's target, and a cloud of tightly-compressed ions form a shield around it for the classic scarlet color of the 'bolt.' Clover projectiles are known to excite particles in the immediate area of impact (including shields), causing localized explosions when subject to repeated impacts.",,,,
vol_cryocannon,WEAPON,"Utilizing barely-understood properties of thermodynamics and a vast internal capacitor, the CPC casts bolts of pure thermal energy at terrifying rates- many less-experienced officers tend to squander it's potential for burst damage.",,,,
vol_halon,WEAPON,"Two Halon units on a single mount was originally a joke amongst senior WSO's- however, the sheer effectiveness in testing saw it almost immediately made standard among Volantian fleets.",,,,
vol_halonMK1,WEAPON,"A refinement of the Burst PD laser, the Halon was developed as a rather simple and straightforward point-defense platform that now sees widespread use in stead of the underwhelming Pata-class autocannon.",,,,
vol_harpecannon,WEAPON,"The Harpe Cannon provides long-range pressure in the form of a very sophisticated caseless ammunition feeder, featuring tungesten-jacketed rail spikes that can pressure shield generators with ease.",,,,
vol_kastane,WEAPON,"The Kastane system has been called by many as a slow, inefficient weapon. Nonetheless, it is dependable and can reliably hit slow-moving targets.",,,,
