volantian_seraph,SHIP,"The Seraph is a unique fusion of the Fulgent and the Sunder-Class midline destroyer. After the Sunder was appropriately upscaled with dubiously-acquired remnant hardware, the newly-dubbed Seraph now sees extensive service in Volantian fleets.                      A terrifying fleet escort, the Seraph posesses two built-in fighter wings, as well as supreme point-defense capabilities and flux capacitors.",,,,
volantian_cherub,SHIP,"The Cherub is the core of Volantian shipping. A modified Atlas frame upgraded with remnant salvage allows for a more efficent, albeit smaller, hull. Nonetheless, it has seen many salvage runs on the outer rim of the Persean Sector.",,,,

volantian_illuminator,SHIP,"The Illuminator is an improved, retrofitted version of the Flagellator-Class destroyer. The Illuminator is outfitted with an improved power and flux grid in return for it's original crusher drive. Nonetheless, it remains a terrifying hunter-killer asset in Volantian patrols.",,,,
volantian_blameless,SHIP,"The Blameless is a massive, technological overhaul of the EIS Indomitable-Class Cruiser. The VRI acquired it's blueprint in a shady, backroom deal with unknown third parties. A mockery of it's former self, the Blameless is a well-placed fleet anchor with plenty of firepower at it's disposal, much to the dismay of Iron Shell officers and generals. ",,,,
volantian_virtuous,SHIP,"The Virtuous is a odd retrofit of the EIS Courageous-Class Frigate. Volantian engineers, upon acquiring it's blueprints, opted to instead rotate the hull 180 degrees and increase it's mobility and flux capabilites. The built-in gunblades have been entirely removed, and the ship is much more maneuverable. The Virtuous is a frequent topic of discussion in IS FLEETCOM, and has triggered relentless security improvements in the Iron Shell and Hegemony alike.",,,,
volantian_curator,SHIP,"The Curator is the core of Volantian salvage fleets. Housing sophisticated sensor and survey equipment and a state-of-the-art salvage gantry, the Curator is the pinnacle of compact and cost effective exploration hulls. It's armaments and power grid are enough to deter pirates and remnants alike.",,,,
volantian_cobalt,SHIP,"Quick and heavily armed, the Cordite is a devastating assault cruiser, capable of outgunning most opponents in a direct gunfight. Volantian Engineers asked a singular question; what if it had another specialized large mount?

While the powerful large mount boosted by a High-Energy Focus system is exceptionally strong, the hull is otherwise slightly undergunned, with especially the available PD grid being heavily limited.",,,,
volantian_rapture,SHIP,"The Rapture is a terrifying tide-turner of any battle. Able to conjure a powerful EMP pulse (without breaking itself apart,) the Rapture is able to take down even the largest of capital vessels- with help.",,,,
volantian_sunder,SHIP,"A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assault frigates. Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving it's performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.",,,,
volantian_fury,SHIP,"A fast-attack high-tech light cruiser, the Fury is designed to choose when and where it strikes to inflict maximum effect upon the enemy. The specialized inbuilt plasma 'microburn' system allows the Fury to make small dashes at high speed to catch unwary opponents off-guard. Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving it's performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.",,,,
volantian_radiant,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after removing the AI core housing and generous application of teal paint.

The Radiant battleship was an outrageous blue-sky design created by some naval architecture unit given special indulgence by a Tri-Tach VP's bloated grandiosity. Both the official and existing unofficial histories of the First AI War never mention this class of ship ever being produced because an integrated phase skimmer could never be stable on a ship of such size. Surely it would explode into an infinity of curiously whorled short-lived child-dimensions upon initiation of the first skip. 

Nonetheless, here it is.",,,,
volantian_kite,SHIP,"A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This compact space/aircraft is streamlined for efficient atmospheric flight and boasts a grid of cleverly distributed short-burst maneuvering thrusters coordinated by a delta-level AI subsystem to ensure smooth landings (a point driven home by Fabrique marketing by way of amusing ad-holos featuring a well-dressed couple and an overfull wine glass). The Kite has powerful engines for a civilian ship of its size, though zero-G maneuverability leaves something to be desired when the special subsystem is not engaged. In the dangerous cycles post-Collapse, the Kite has been outfitted with a defense turret in place of the executive-class viewing dome and the two auxiliary jet-pods are replaced with missile systems (which do not need to draw on the limited powerplant). It won't stand up in a fair fight, but the Kite can be given unexpectedly sharp teeth and use its speed to escape from raiders. Luddic Path radicals have even been known to use modified Kite to deliver strike weapons against helpless freighters, followed by engaging the maneuvering subsystem to make a swift exit to avoid the wrath of their victim's escort. Volantian engineers have upgraded this ship with remnant hardware and parts, improving it's performance in battle and providing a unique niche in Volantian fleets.",,,,
