Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The pinnacle of the Volantian frigate lineup, the Metatron-class frigate is a powerful force to have in any engagement- armed with several upscaled energy mounts and a temporal shell generator, it’s a wonder that this relatively tiny hull can fit enough crew to operate it effectively, let alone comfortably.

The Metatron was conceived (alongside their child) by two star-crossed lovers hailing from the VRI’s engineering division and Tri-Tachyon’s R&D team. Using the Hyperion as a template, the two worked day and night to create the perfect frigate. When the Metatron appeared in Tri-Tachyon intelligence reports, one had safely relocated the other to Volantis.

Despite its supreme firepower and tactical capabilities, the Metatron is rarely deployed in Volantian fleets due to its ability to eat through supplies at a rate that frequently puts it at a negative benefit/cost ratio. Nonetheless, officers that see its potential often pilot it themselves, despite its horrid crew accommodations. ",,,,

The Claymore is a relatively new design, first seeing widespread use in the late Domain Era.

The Curator is the core of Volantian salvage fleets. Housing sophisticated sensor and survey equipment and a state-of-the-art salvage gantry, the Curator is the pinnacle of compact and cost effective exploration hulls. While its weaponry suite is lackluster for a ship of its size, the Curator can reliably fend off weaker threats, such as Domain Explorarium Derelicts or the odd pirate.

The Apogee-Class has always been the trademark of surveyor and scavenger fleets across the sector- after a copy of its blueprints was sourced (alongside many others) from the Maxios Charter polity in the Volantian lend-lease agreement, the Volantians quickly got to work stripping the hull of the more fragile and inefficient parts of the sensor suite, downgrading its weapon slots to house its internal salvage gantry, and cut down on its logistical profile.

Quick and heavily armed, the Cordite is a devastating assault cruiser, capable of outgunning most opponents in a direct gunfight.

Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after substituting the AI core housing with a rudimentary life support system and providing a generous application of teal paint.

The Radiant battleship was an outrageous blue-sky design created by some naval architecture unit given special indulgence by a Tri-Tach VP's bloated grandiosity. Both the official and existing unofficial histories of the First AI War never mention this class of ship ever being produced because an integrated phase skimmer could never be stable on a ship of such size. Surely it would explode into an infinity of curiously whorled short-lived child-dimensions upon initiation of the first skip. 

Nonetheless, here it is.",,,,
volantian_sandalphon_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Sandalphon-class frigate is somewhat of a stop-gap measure, cobbled together in the early days of the VRI. Designed for the sole purpose of chasing down wounded and retreating AI Remnant vessels, the Sandalphon features an integrated autopulse laser, a light and nimble frame, and an integrated temporal engine allowing for use of the ""Transfix Shift"" system for chasing down and flanking the fastest frigates, serving as a peerless hunter and performing lightning-fast maneuvers in the thick of battle.

In the dawn of the VRI, when resources were short and manpower was shorter, the Sandalphon was originally completely automated. In preparation for the political emergence of the Volantian polity on the grand scale of the sector, the design was quickly (barely) de-automated in compliance with the treaty of the First AI War. In the present day, the Sandalphon is widely employed in Volantian fleets and has been praised by fleet tacticians and condemned by engineers across the sector.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

A technologically advanced frigate with an efficient shield generator and an impressive weapons package that allows it to punch far above its weight. These same characteristics mean its frigate-grade power core struggles to keep up, making careful flux management a priority.",,,,
volantian_medusa_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

A fearsome ship whose top-tier engines provide great speed and maneuverability for a destroyer. Multiple energy weapon slots allow for a plethora of tactical possibilities. Its best-in-class performance is matched by a demanding logistical profile that has led some fleet commanders to eschew its use in favor of other ships that can be deployed more frequently and cheaply.

The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the sector due to its association with black ops and elite pirates. The few that have been aboard a Medusa can attest to its extreme level of technological sophistication. Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are some of the rarest and most closely guarded data in the Sector.

Deemed too expensive to mass produce by most corporations and governments, it is rarely employed by the lawful authorities as a black ops cruiser. On the rarest occasion, a Medusa-class hull may fall into the hands of pirates. The usual results are a drastic reduction in system small to medium shipping, which puts a strain on most planetary and outpost economies.

Sector naval tacticians have few answers for the threat that the Medusa presents.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

A unique design hailing from Volantian fleets, the Lancet combines the speed of the Shrike-Class hull and the firepower of the Medusa-Class hull. A cruiser-grade power core and advanced targeting arrays allow the Lancet to punch far above its weight, only being hindered by its logistic profile.

The Lancet’s concept was originally perpetuated as a joke among senior officers in the VRI, only becoming an actual blueprint after an R&D request made in jest somehow made it all the way to finalization and production.",,,,
volantian_chromatic,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Chromatic is a relatively new pattern of remnant hull, only being officially documented after the second AI war. Its frontal-facing firepower and ability to overcharge its energy capacitors make it a terrifying threat to any fleet tactician. It is somewhat hindered by its relatively low top speed and lack of a phase skimmer, though.

The Chromatic has been specifically noted to be a threat to slower, heavily armored hulls like the Onslaught or the Dominator- however, due to its low maneuverability, it has trouble dealing with faster, more evasive vessels which can flank its relatively unprotected backside.",,,,

Few vessels can hold a candle to the pure logistical power of the Caelum.",,,,
volantian_lancet_lt,SHIP,"This particular variant of the Lancet-class features an experimental targeting core, completely overhauled subsystems, and ballistic mounts- suitable for long-range pressure and fire support.

This low-tech variant of the Lancet was quickly comissioned by the VRI's chief spymaster; after the inital mistake of it's creation was discovered and the junior officers were reprimanded, of course. It would become a part of a scheme to topple the Hegemony's entire espionage infrastructure in the VRI. Nowadays, this hull is routinely seen in Hegemony fleets. The amount of blood spilled, operatives lost, and hours of espionage work lost in exchange for this hull far outweights it's ironically small logistics profile. ",,,,

The Lancet and it's XIV variant was carefully painted as a hull comissioned in secret by Kali Molina, the soon-to-be first High Hegemon, before the collapse occured. Reports were then carefully fabricated to claim that the design had recently found it's way into Volantian posession. This fake intel was leaked to the entire VRI espionage network, it was only a matter of time before a Hegemony operative took the bait.

This curious variant of the TTDS-pattern Lumen exists as a 'test' to see how easily the AI Remnants could be influenced by the VRI.

The Cressida is a smaller-sized vessel that utilizes the same principles as the Doom-Class Cruiser to lay mines, while doing so safely with the use of it's phase cloak. It has decent armor for a phase ship, allowing it to spend more time in harm's way delivering heavy ordinance.

The Prismatic-Class destroyer is a nimble, terrifying vessel that has only appeared quite recently in remnant fleets. Many reports detail its striking tactical similarity to the Sunder-Class destroyer, featuring heavy frontal firepower, a somewhat limited PD suite, and a fragile hull. However, several notable improvements, in the form of a fighter bay, mount versatility, and an improved shield emitter makes for a truly formidable destroyer. In the hands of an AI core, the phrase 'glass cannon' comes to mind.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Naegling is an ambitious design that initally saw use during the Volantian Imperial era, against the Luddic Church in the early cycles after the collapse. Fleet admirals cited the Naegling's heavy fighter complement and ample point defense net as a saving grace against the Church's overwhelming numbers of strike craft. However, the hull also sports an above-average weapons suite that has earned it the title of a battlecarrier.",,,,
volantian_eagle_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Often called the Eagle cruiser's little brother, the Falcon-class cruiser sacrifices armor for speed, neatly filling the light cruiser role in military fleets throughout the Sector. 

The ""light"" designation does not indicate a significant reduction in firepower, however, making the Falcon a valuable tactical asset to any fleet. The ship is easily able to fill a wide variety of roles, from close support to assault, given the proper configuration. 

The Falcon's top notch engines give it the ability to quickly disengage from battle should its defenses be pressed to a critical point.

Swift and elegant, Falcon-class cruisers are often found as lead elements in larger fleet formations, or deployed to reinforce anti-pirate convoys.",,,,
volantian_hippocampus_vri,SHIP,"This ship has been given superficial markings and modifications to align with the aesthetic and operational needs of the Volantian fleet.

Taking note of the rapidly changing situation in the Persean Sector, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation investigated an alternative to the Venture that could deal with the new chaotic realities they found themselves in. The culmination of this research was the Hippocampus, a modification of the Gemini with improved flux systems, a conversion to a more flexible weapons and flight deck loadout, and the inclusion of a very sophisticated range of photometric scanners, deep-terrain sensors and atmosphere characterisation equipment that drastically reduces the workload cost required to carry out a survey. The Volantian adjustment to the modular LPC's are also capable of fabricating salvage equipment to be fitted to fighter chassis, assisting in salvage efforts. The cost of the 'Hippo's attractive capabilities is a drastic loss in cargo space and relatively high logistical profile, requiring a sizeable investment in support vessels to support it.",,,,
volantian_ionos_vri,SHIP,"A prime example of ancient Volantian Imperium fleet doctrine engineered to the standards of the post-collapse sector, this ship is proudly augmented with reverse engineered technology, remnant salvage, and teal paint. Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Possibly the largest (known) vessel with a phase skimmer, the Ionos-class is a comparatively undergunned and logisitically expensive battlecruiser. However, with the superior mobility afforded by its skimmer system combined with capital-grade flux systems, the Ionos is a surprisingly nimble and dangerous foe to face.

The Ionos-class is a vessel shrouded in mystery. Its development at first appeared to be a straightforward improvement on a relatively new Domain Navy design from before the collapse. Over time, its developmental histroy got increasingly hazy and unclear, until the First AI War, wherein the class's development history vanishes completely from known records. Recently the ship has been spotted in Tri-Tachyon fleets, although its rarity has prevented a full examination of the differences from the old design. In fact, some Hegemony analysts consider the current day Ionos a completely different design from the original in development before the War, and only keep the hull's classification for simplicity.

The Ionos is, theoretically, the largest vessel that can safely utilise a phase skimmer without disappearing into phase space or suffer long term effects on crew. It is primarily because of the oversized skimmer device that the vessel is so disproporitonately expensive to maintain.",,,,

The Fulgent is a heavily armed destroyer which earns its place in the line of battle through judicious amounts of heavy ordinance, a light and robust frame, and a powerful electrical grid. The integrated energy bolt coherer has remained an integral (albeit hindered) system, despite numerous complaints from Volantian admirality of increased crew casualties due to radiation leaks.

Although operationalized in the Retribution design, the Orion Drive was never popular with crew or naval architects due to the great strain each jolt the propulsion system inflicted upon flesh and hardware. This Nova reintroduces human crew, alongside a cutting-edge inertia buffer system, with internal compartments and hardware being specially engineered, avoiding completely fixed positions to reduce the impact of the sudden 'jolt' caused by engaging the drive. The result takes the form of a terrifying battlecruiser with the movement capabilities of its inspiration combined with the flexibility and self-preservation of human crew.

A favorite of pirates and private armies due to the ubiquity of the blueprints and its non-demanding support profile, Lasher-class frigates pack a respectable amount of ballistic firepower.

Lasher captains are usually no-nonsense types who let their weapons do the talking, and pick through the debris of enemy ships as opposed to trying more diplomatic or covert means of getting the job done. More often than not, that job involves quickly and effectively striking at (or guarding) small or medium-sized trade convoys. The light fighter and frigate escorts usually found guarding such convoys are hardly a match for the hail of projectiles a Lasher can quickly unleash. If that does not get the job done, the Lasher has another nasty surprise in wait - two missile hardpoints, more often than not fitted with ""finisher"" types of missile, such as the Harpoon MRM.",,,,

The Manticore is loved by frontier officers for its ability to rapidly bring firepower to bear in small engagements and loathed by Domain strategic planners for interfering with the orderly schema of official fleet doctrine. The Manticore's oversized primary weapon mount and built-in rangefinder are a gunner's dream but allow this destroyer to easily overextend itself in battle. That, operators argue, is what the canister flak system is for - and stripping the paint off your allied ships, as the old joke goes. 

A healthy respect for intimidating firepower in a small package see this design continue in the service of fleets of the Persean Sector. When the opportunity presents itself, pirates are particularly keen to recover a Manticore hull and apply blood-red livery to their overgunned prize.",,,,
volantian_eradicator_vi,SHIP,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine. Maneuverability is increased, targeting systems have integrated several unique technologies, and weapon mount versatility has improved.

A resilient design often overlooked by history, the Eradicator-class fast cruiser features powerful dual engine nacelles that allow it to deliver uncompromising firepower and a powerful missile barrage to the weakest point of the enemy battleline - or come to the rescue of valuable assets that have found themselves tactically exposed.

Back in the long cycles of the Domain, a chance accident during a fleet demonstration set one of an Eradicator's engine nacelles into shutdown and the other into overdrive, putting the ship into a terrible spin only stopped by a heroic effort from the engineering crew. Worse than the injuries and casualties suffered was the ship class becoming the laughingstock of a significant portion of the Domain hypermedia sphere. To save face the admiralty quietly assigned all of the Eradicators to frontier duty, far from the fickle attentions of the core sector budget committees. It would take a generation and several difficult fringe rebellion mop-up operations before a new fast-cruiser class model was requested by the Domain Navy to replace the Eradicator's role in front-line battlefleets.",,,,
volantian_dominator_vi,SHIP,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine. Maneuverability is increased, targeting systems have integrated several unique technologies, and weapon mount versatility has improved.

Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. 

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents. ",,,,
volantian_legion_vi,SHIP,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine. Maneuverability is increased, targeting systems have integrated several unique technologies, and weapon mount versatility has improved.

Classified as a battlecarrier, the Legion mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons, hangar-space, and command-control sufficient to field four fighter wings. Later models were upgraded with nanoforges keyed to replacement of fightercraft, significantly increasing tooth-to-tail ratio on distant deployments.

After the legendary success of the Onslaught design it became clear that rebellious systems without ultra-heavy industry were able to develop carrier-based strike-craft capable of countering the 'Old Man' of the Armada. Alongside new weapons - nimble anti-fighter missiles and rapid-tracking point defense cannon - the Strategic Council decided to deploy a carrier worthy of service alongside the Onslaught. Thus the Legion was designed to provide a platform for interceptors and strike-craft while standing on the line of battle. 

Proponents of the 'Cruiser School' criticized the Legion for insufficient specialization, maintaining that similar fighter volume can be fielded at less cost and greater flexibility if combat roles are separated into distinct ship hulls. These economic arguments do pale in the face of an incoming Legion engaging its burn drive to deliver crushing firepower at the key point of battle.",,,,
volantian_vanguard_vi,SHIP,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine. Maneuverability is increased, targeting systems have integrated several unique technologies, and weapon mount versatility has improved.

An ancient and tough heavy frigate featuring robust construction and jury-rigged modern shields. Furthermore, the Vanguard is equipped with an integrated Damper Field of archaic design but tuned to modern standards. This allows the Vanguard to shrug off anti-armor weapons while leaving lighter defense to its heavy armor enhanced by the obscure physics of resonant field-dampening.

This design is old enough to be contemporary with early models of the Onslaught battleship, though unlike that illustrious pillar of the Domain Navy the Vanguard was retired from service long before the collapse of the Gate network. In the post-Collapse chaos it was a chance discovery by an enterprising arms dealer that saw relatively complete schematics of the Vanguard-class heavy frigate lifted from an overlooked museum exhibit. The atavistic and aggressive design opens an unexpected niche for the Vanguard in modern fleets - with the added advantage that all essential components have been declassified for ages, and are of simple make; even repair of catastrophic damage is relatively straightforward.",,,,
volantian_condor_vi,SHIP,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine. Maneuverability is increased, targeting systems have integrated several unique technologies, and weapon mount versatility has improved.

The Condor-class sees heavy service in the Sector as this carrier-converted freighter is, for many independent polities, the easiest way to procure fighter capability for their organization. Even with limited flight deck space, the Condor gets the job done, relying on its tough armor, excellent bulkhead strength, and a respectable (for a light carrier) weapons package.

This light carrier design is derived from Tarsus-class freighters modified by desperate scavengers and pirates. The conversion process was once an involved and complex affair requiring space dock facilities, but nowadays any hull-capable forge that will accept a stock Tarsus spec will, with the addition of a custom modchip, get you something just as good.

Some in the Sector argue that even the Domain, with all their technological know-how, relied on similar conversions to make more efficient use of a merchant fleet during times of escalated hostilities on the voluminous galactic frontier. Others point out that it is unclear how ubiquitous this approach was - there could have been fleets of Condors roaming Domain space, but there is scarce hard evidence one way or the other. Such data was all lost in the Collapse.",,,,
volantian_enforcer_vi,SHIP,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine. Maneuverability is increased, targeting systems have integrated several unique technologies, and weapon mount versatility has improved.

The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. 

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony logistics bureaucrats.",,,,
volantian_monitor_vi,SHIP,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine. Maneuverability is increased, targeting systems have integrated several unique technologies, and weapon mount versatility has improved.

An oddity among ships, the Monitor is the result of the line of thought that �sometimes the best defense is indeed the best defense�. Features turret mounts angled to provide wide arcs and dual integrated flak cannons for optimal point-defense support. Indeed, the Monitor makes up for a lack of maneuverability and firepower with the ability to withstand prolonged bombardment from enemy ordnance.

Though its experimental nature is perhaps a sign of the innovation that eras of turmoil seem to inspire, whether the Monitor�s radical defensive focus is a boon or pitfall remains contentious. Several dramatic failures in convoy protection patrols were explained by Ko Combine PR representatives to be the fault of improper tactics employed by convoy commanders. Ko Combine maintains that when positioned correctly in a combat situation and supported by strike-craft - as the anvil and hammer, respectively - simulations demonstrate that the Monitor significantly enhances convoy survivability against the average pirate attack. Prominent critics remain.",,,,
volantian_heron_vi,SHIP,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine. Maneuverability is increased, targeting systems have integrated several unique technologies, and weapon mount versatility has improved.

The Heron provides the strategic and tactical mobility of a cruiser with potential firepower limited only by available strike-craft. It is the perfect accompaniment to the quick-moving and hard-hitting fleet of an admiral who knows when to take the initiative, hit quickly, and withdraw while enemy forces are still responding to the threat.

Historically the Heron represented a movement in Domain Armada strategy from a heavy capital ship doctrine based on overwhelming firepower toward a focus on strike craft and support cruisers that enable sufficient firepower to be quickly focused on weak points, a strategic shift that would reverse itself as a natural reaction against tradition from each successive generation of Armada officers. This process was occurring once more in the cycles immediately preceding the fall of the gate system and, in something of a coup for the so-called �Cruiser School�, the forward-thinking Altair Exotech won the Heron design contract over the traditional manufacturer of heavy Armada warships, Orion Shipyards. 

However the doctrinal shift embodied by the Heron was interrupted by the isolation of The Fall, and as such it is not often found in core Hegemony fleets (whose officers still cling to tradition). This hull has however found great popularity among the independent worlds, megacorporations, and mercenary forces of the Sector that tend to field leaner, faster fleets.",,,,
volantian_glare,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation.

The Glare-Class is a more recent pattern of remnant hulls, theorized to be a refinement of the new and ""rougher"" Nova-Class. The Glare's nova burst system is precariously mounted; the hull's internal durasteel-composite webbing and interlocking armor plates keep the orion drive from literally breaking the ship apart.

An azorian AI core can easily pass for human, similar to a beta.
