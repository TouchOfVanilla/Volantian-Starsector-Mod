The pinnacle of the Volantian frigate lineup, the Metatron-class frigate is a powerful force to have in any engagement- armed with several upscaled energy mounts and a temporal shell generator, it’s a wonder that this relatively tiny hull can fit enough crew to operate it effectively, let alone comfortably.

The Metatron was conceived (alongside their child) by two star-crossed lovers hailing from the VRI’s engineering division and Tri-Tachyon’s R&D team. Using the Hyperion as a template, the two worked day and night to create the perfect frigate. When the Metatron appeared in Tri-Tachyon intelligence reports, one had safely relocated the other to Volantis.

Despite its supreme firepower and tactical capabilities, the Metatron is rarely deployed in Volantian fleets due to its ability to eat through supplies at a rate that frequently puts it at a negative benefit/cost ratio. Nonetheless, officers that see its potential often pilot it themselves, despite its horrid crew accommodations. ",,,,

While its weaponry suite is lackluster for a ship of its size, the Curator can reliably fend off weaker threats, such as Domain Explorarium Derelicts or the odd pirate.

The Apogee-Class has always been the trademark of surveyor and scavenger fleets across the sector- after a copy of its blueprints was sourced (alongside many others) from the Maxios Charter polity in the Volantian lend-lease agreement, the Volantians quickly got to work stripping the hull of the more fragile and inefficient parts of the sensor suite, downgrading its weapon slots to house its internal salvage gantry, and cut down on its logistical profile.

The Radiant battleship was an outrageous blue-sky design created by some naval architecture unit given special indulgence by a Tri-Tach VP's bloated grandiosity. Both the official and existing unofficial histories of the First AI War never mention this class of ship ever being produced because an integrated phase skimmer could never be stable on a ship of such size. Surely it would explode into an infinity of curiously whorled short-lived child-dimensions upon initiation of the first skip.

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

The Sandalphon-class frigate is somewhat of a stop-gap measure, cobbled together in the early days of the VRI. Designed for the sole purpose of chasing down wounded and retreating AI Remnant vessels, the Sandalphon features an integrated autopulse laser, a light and nimble frame, and an integrated temporal engine allowing for use of the ""Transfix Shift"" system for chasing down and flanking the fastest frigates, serving as a peerless hunter and performing lightning-fast maneuvers in the thick of battle.

In the dawn of the VRI, when resources were short and manpower was shorter, the Sandalphon was originally completely automated. In preparation for the political emergence of the Volantian polity on the grand scale of the sector, the design was quickly (barely) de-automated in compliance with the treaty of the First AI War. In the present day, the Sandalphon is widely employed in Volantian fleets and has been praised by fleet tacticians and condemned by engineers across the sector.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

A fearsome ship whose top-tier engines provide great speed and maneuverability for a destroyer. Multiple energy weapon slots allow for a plethora of tactical possibilities. Its best-in-class performance is matched by a demanding logistical profile that has led some fleet commanders to eschew its use in favor of other ships that can be deployed more frequently and cheaply.

The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the sector due to its association with black ops and elite pirates. The few that have been aboard a Medusa can attest to its extreme level of technological sophistication. Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are some of the rarest and most closely guarded data in the Sector.

Deemed too expensive to mass produce by most corporations and governments, it is rarely employed by the lawful authorities as a black ops cruiser. On the rarest occasion, a Medusa-class hull may fall into the hands of pirates. The usual results are a drastic reduction in system small to medium shipping, which puts a strain on most planetary and outpost economies.

Sector naval tacticians have few answers for the threat that the Medusa presents.",,,,

The Chromatic is a relatively new pattern of remnant hull, only being officially documented after the second AI war. Its frontal-facing firepower and ability to overcharge its energy capacitors make it a terrifying threat to any fleet tactician. It is somewhat hindered by its relatively low top speed and lack of a phase skimmer, though.

The Chromatic has been specifically noted to be a threat to slower, heavily armored hulls like the Onslaught or the Dominator- however, due to its low maneuverability, it has trouble dealing with faster, more evasive vessels which can flank its relatively unprotected backside.",,,,

Volantian ships are structurally identical to their baseline counterparts, but have noted improvements in nearly every other aspect, or even fit completely new roles in a fleet.

Possibly the largest (known) vessel with a phase skimmer, the Ionos-class is a comparatively undergunned and logisitically expensive battlecruiser. However, with the superior mobility afforded by its skimmer system combined with capital-grade flux systems, the Ionos is a surprisingly nimble and dangerous foe to face.

The Ionos-class is a vessel shrouded in mystery. Its development at first appeared to be a straightforward improvement on a relatively new Domain Navy design from before the collapse. Over time, its developmental histroy got increasingly hazy and unclear, until the First AI War, wherein the class's development history vanishes completely from known records. Recently the ship has been spotted in Tri-Tachyon fleets, although its rarity has prevented a full examination of the differences from the old design. In fact, some Hegemony analysts consider the current day Ionos a completely different design from the original in development before the War, and only keep the hull's classification for simplicity.

The Ionos is, theoretically, the largest vessel that can safely utilise a phase skimmer without disappearing into phase space or suffer long term effects on crew. It is primarily because of the oversized skimmer device that the vessel is so disproporitonately expensive to maintain.",,,,

Retrofitted and overhauled for use by humans, the VRI now uses these (technically) legal vessels to fill the ranks of their fleets, after substituting the AI core housing with a rudimentary life support system and providing a generous application of teal paint.

The Fulgent is a heavily armed destroyer which earns its place in the line of battle through judicious amounts of heavy ordinance, a light and robust frame, and a powerful electrical grid. The integrated energy bolt coherer has remained an integral (albeit hindered) system, despite numerous complaints from Volantian admirality of increased crew casualties due to radiation leaks. The Fulgent is a rare case in which the VRI will officially endorse hazard pay- making this hull a popular choice among fleet admirals looking to increase their budget.",,,,

Although operationalized in the Retribution design, the Orion Drive was never popular with crew or naval architects due to the great strain each jolt the propulsion system inflicted upon flesh and hardware. This Nova reintroduces human crew, alongside a cutting-edge inertia buffer system, with internal compartments and hardware being specially engineered, avoiding completely fixed positions to reduce the impact of the sudden 'jolt' caused by engaging the drive.

Naval tacticians of the subject (however few they are, considering the general attitude on automated warships in the sector) universally agree that automated warships best fit support roles. While the human captains prove their valor and competence in the decisive moments of the battle, the Evercer evens the odds with saturated ordinance.",,,,
volantian_perpetua,SHIP,"This hull is a vestige of an ancient Domain-Era automated defense system. Little is known about its history or design details, yet its repair, maintainance, and operation are remarkably familiar and simple for the current state of the sector.

The Perpetua is, by all accounts, a fine vessel well-suited for fleet support. The sleek, white, and attractive design made it the ideal choice to star in a wildly popular Domain-Era hypermedia series as the flagship of the main antagonist, which was eventually blown up by a human fighter pilot.",,,,
volantian_aeten,SHIP,"This hull is a vestige of an ancient Domain-Era automated defense system. Little is known about its history or design details, yet its repair, maintainance, and operation are remarkably familiar and simple for the current state of the sector.

The Aeten is a ballistics-oriented frigate which can serve many roles in a fleet- however, it is often delegated to support and escort roles, due to the canister flak system which sees popular use among the less admirable captains of the sector.",,,,
volantian_incursor,SHIP,"This hull is a vestige of an ancient Domain-Era automated defense system. Little is known about its history or design details, yet its repair, maintainance, and operation are remarkably familiar and simple for the current state of the sector.

Few hulls are selected as testbeds for highly advanced phase technology, and fewer can match the sheer presence of the Incursor. Initally criticized for the unusual combination of shield and phase technology and a multitude of worrying psychological issues borne from the prototype phase coils, complaints were not helped by its above average logistic profile. However, the Incursor passed Domain naval commission trials with flying colors- and subsequently disappeared, along with the rest of its designer parent company, presumably into whatever sequence of events that led to the creation of this prototype defense system.",,,,
volantian_core,RESOURCE,"Whether the azorian cores can be considered AI cores is a hotly debated topic among the triple-digit number of individuals that know of their existence. These modified alpha cores utilize the awesome informational power of Azorian crystals to accomplish their directives- however, an azorian core is unmistakably Volantian.

Selling AI cores on the open market is prohibited by most factions. However, higher-up faction representatives are often willing to exchange AI cores for large sums of cash when communicated with directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

An azorian AI core can easily pass for human, similar to a beta. It boasts marginally better processing capabilities than a baseline beta, as many of the hyper-performance CPUs characteristic of alphas have been replaced with azorian crystal matricies. This loss of processing speed is remedied by the elimination of latency in both interstellar and planetary operations, if provided appropriate infrastructure.",,,,
vri,FACTION,"The Volantian Reclamation Initiative is the relatively new scion of the fallen Volantian Empire, a long-dead polity that traces its origins back to the first sporeships that reached the Persean Sector, long before the reign of the Domain of Man. The VRI slowly reclaims the husk of their former empire, rapidly growing into a power of the sector and restoring their former heritage. Their liberal use of barely-legal AI and “unsanctioned” privateering and raiding has created several enemies- which the VAF works valiantly to keep at bay-but their openness to trade and collaborate have earned them a sizeable backing from the other polities of the Persean Sector.",,,,
daedalus_station,CUSTOM,"A shattered astropolis of the former Volantian Empire. Mostly dead and derelict, with most useful materials being stripped or destroyed long ago.",,,,
vri_planet_Tally,CUSTOM,"A mostly unremarkable cryovolcanic world. The presence of ruins and the abundance of resources has earned the attention of the VSB, and countless techmining and salvage missions have been conducted on its surface, but no formal action has been taken yet.",,,,
vri_planet_Eminence,CUSTOM,"This standard terran-qualifying world comes back alarmingly hot on radiation scans- yet, even from the naked eye, the biosphere on the planetary surface flourishes. Incredibly dangerous for unshielded humans.",,,,
vri_planet_Volantis,CUSTOM,"Volantis is the namesake and former capital of the Volantian empire- the ancestral homeworld of every reclaimer in the Persean sector. While being a shadow of its former glory, progress is evident- ruined arcologies slowly repaired, ancient caches of domain-era technology unearthed, and ancient ideals and revanchism steadily becoming more prominent.",,"From orbit, the lights of the countless cities and population centers make a perfectly organized pattern, hinting at the planet’s almost inhuman efficiency. Reflecting the planet's importance, the planetary administration has enacted a policy of zero pollution, though increasing Hegemony pressure and ever-increasing need for military hardware is likely to change that.

",,
vri_planet_Desmond,CUSTOM,"Desmond’s Landing is the steadily growing industrial center of the VRI; buried miles underneath of the tectonically-stable crust of the barren world lies a complicated tunnel network. Hab-complexes, industrial districts, artificial ecosystems, and other components of subterranean inhabitation all rest comfortably beneath protective lead plating. Originally sought after due to its rich ore deposits, Desmond’s Landing has become a remarkably thriving and bustling population and industrial center.",,"The surface is unusually devoid of light, with infrastructure only diverging from the deep crust to provide entryway for commercial and military spacecraft. An automated transmission gives you the locations of various docking points scattered about the surface of the planet. The transmission also gives info on scheduling a time to request the heavy lead shielding to be retracted, so your fleet may dock.",,
vri_SubA1,CUSTOM,"Sublimation Platform A1 is a massive siphon station orbiting around Okeanos. Dubbed “Spay-1” by the locals that operate the advanced siphoning systems, it constantly extracts volatiles from the surface of Okeanos and exports it to Volantian fuel plants. Originally, Sublimation Platform A1 was the grounds for an hypothetical automated volatile collection platform. This was quickly put on indefinite suspension due to budget concerns and uncooperative AI. Thus, Sublimation Platform A1 was relegated to use as a population center and a volatiles siphoning station, albeit a manual one. Each and every individual level of the station is perfectly constructed and laid out in an incredibly efficient manner.",,"As you approach the station, an automated message reminds you to not approach Okeanos, or interfere with the service, maintenance, or collection drones that dart about the station. They’re all painted teal, and their transponders clearly identify that they are all, infact, drones, and they will not adjust heading for you or your fleet. A set of navigational buoys guides you towards one of the station’s many docking platforms.",,
vri_planet_Geir,CUSTOM,"A shining example of post-collapse terraforming efforts and technology, Geir’s Slab was a planet sought after by the Eridani-Utopia terraforming corporation in the pre-collapse era for the sheer abundance of ice in its upper crust. However, interest in the planet was quickly lost after it was discovered that its orbit around Okeanos dragged the planet through one of the dust rings of the star system, subjecting the surface to seasonal orbital bombardment severe enough to make any colonization effort grueling at best. Hundreds of cycles later, the newly-formed Volantian Reclamation Initiative saw unique potential in Geir’s Slab. With the use of their global artillery network “Aegis,” the planet is now protected from the seasonal meteor showers, with a 95.3% coverage rate. Terraforming efforts are slow, and the temperatures remain quite harsh, but to quote the planetary administration: “It gets a little greener every year.”",,"As your fleet enters orbit, you watch the Aegis system hard at work, with the occasional streak of durasteel slugs accelerated at frightening speeds impacting on unseen asteroids and celestial bodies as they approach the planet. An automated broadcast from the net of navigational and telemetry buoys around the planet reminds you to keep your transponder on, lest you are mistaken for a meteorite.",,
vri_Nocturne,CUSTOM,"Nocturne Station is viewed by many as the eternal shield of the Uelyst system, one of the best officer schools of the entire sector, one of the largest garrisons of the VAF, and a gutted-out remnant station. With most autonomous infrastructure being removed and repurposed for more useful matters like life support and housing, Nocturne Station attracted the attention of the VAF for the abundance of military hardware already integrally present in the station- with some relatively minor adjustments, the same autofactories that churned out legions of cyan droneships now bolster the ranks of the Volantian Fleet with it’s almost unparalleled industrial might.",,"You’re not used to being this close to a remnant nexus without seeing it through a web of targeting solutions. Your crew shares your caution- the bridge is dead silent as you pass by the radiation-scarred armor plating and the dormant weapons pods that bristle on every side of the station. After what feels like an eternity, you finally pull into one of the many hangar docks that have been carved into the station.",,
vri_Stalos,CUSTOM,"Stalos Outpost is an automated drone nexus that was converted into an industrial and militarized habitat, much like Nocturne. However, Stalos Outpost is devoted to being the headquarters of the Volantian Salvage Bureau. Dockyards and supply depots pepper the station, which serves as the staging grounds for salvage, research, and survey operations to Tally and Eminence. Initially, Stalos outpost was a dull and quiet frontier outpost- however, with the arrival of the VSB, the station is emboldened with new spirit as hopeful and curious flock to the station in hopes of finding ancient treasures.",,"You’re not used to being this close to a remnant nexus without seeing it through a web of targeting solutions.

vri_visegrad,CUSTOM,"This dry desert planet of extremes serves as the main outpost and staging grounds for the Hegemony against the Volantian polity. Sporting vast arrays of solar panels to capitalize on the harsh stellar conditions and power the local Hegemony garrison, life struggles to exist on Visegrad in noteriety.",,,,
vri_aberdeen,CUSTOM,"This former Volantian colony is shrouded by an omnipresent layer of clouds, giving way to a riotous hydrosphere which relentlessly batters the shelters of what few post-fall survivors remain. Scans also read back a largely-defunct lightning rod network encircling the entire planet.",,,,
vri_chesapeake,CUSTOM,"The floating arcologies and seafloor cities of Chesapeake are second only by those of Sindrian Volturn- in beauty, and in population. The independent-aligning polity is fiercely loyal to the VRI, as a result of a long-standing defensive pact. A tenuous peace exists between the Chesapeake Navy and the hegemony's outpost on Espoz- which, ironically, sees itself relying on Chesapeake during supply line disruptions.",,,,
arkship_ontos,CUSTOM,"Ontos-117 is the vessel in which the VRI braved the post-collapse Persean sector after the fall of the Volantian Empire in the decivilized fringes before the eventual reclamation. The vast majority of the population was evacuated to the massive cryostorage arrays in cycle 48, when the Domain 14th Battlegroup arrived in the sector and threataned the soverignty of the Volantian polity. Today, it serves as a mobile operating base and the seat of the Volantian Fleet Command.",,,,
vri_storm,PLANET,"A habitable, albeit tumoltuous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere dominated by an omnipresent storm. The riotous hydrosphere prevents any natural landmasses from reaching above sea level and the thick cloud cover prevents most sunlight from reaching the surface, leaving the world mostly lifeless; save for a few hardy species of  introduced alage.",,,,
