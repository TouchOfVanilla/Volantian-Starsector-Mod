Ordinance Catalyst,vestskill,,,Vestige,,,,,TRUE,,-20,-40,-60,-80,data.hullmods.VestSkill,"The Catalyst Core's highly-specialized ordinance efficency and refinement protocols are able to substantially increase the total ordinance points available to this hull by %s, based on hull size.",,graphics/factions/Vestige_crest.png
Selective Auxillary Shield,selauxshield,,,Common,,,10000,,TRUE,,5,10,20,30,data.hullmods.SelectiveAuxillaryShield,A jury-rigged shield core with a flux grid independent from its host ship. The autonomous programming is programmed to intercept %s and %s. The shield is limited by lengthy overload times.,,graphics/hullmods/auxillary_selective_shield.png
VRI Flux Network,VRI_FluxNetwork,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VRI_FluxNetwork,"Volantian ships are outfitted with an advanced transponder array which allows them to share fleetwide computational loads. Increases weapon flux efficiency and shield efficiency based on the maximum flux of allied ships deployed with this hullmod. Ships with makeshift networks contribute a lower proportion of their flux maximum to the bonus.

Furthermore, the network has safety interlocks to prevent the damage of internal components and electricity grids caused by the computational and mechanical strain of an abundance of Volantian hulls interlinked by the network. Volantian Officers are specially trained to minimize this effect, and to partially disable the interlocks. Makeshift Flux networks are not affected.",,graphics/hullmods/VRI_FluxNetwork.png
Azorian Matrices,azorian_matrices,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.AzorianMatrices,"This hull's internal machinery and design are built around an integral network of Azorian crystals, which allow for superluminal communication- through a solid conduit of the crystal, or highly advanced, short-range emitters. This exponential decrease of processing delay allows for incredibly precise, real-time measurements and information.

All modifiers to %s are also applied to %s.

The %s is applied to %s at double its value.",,graphics/hullmods/azorian_matrix.png
Makeshift VRI Flux Network,VRI_MakeshiftFluxNetwork,,,Volantian,,,10000,,TRUE,,5,10,15,20,data.hullmods.VRI_MakeshiftFluxNetwork,A makeshift version of the VRI transponder array which allows them to share fleetwide computational loads. Increases weapon flux efficiency and shield efficiency by a slightly reduced amount based on the maximum flux of allied ships deployed with this hullmod. Contributes a lower proportion of this ship's flux maximum to the bonus.,,graphics/hullmods/VRI_FluxNetwork.png
Volantian Engineering,VES,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianEngineering,"Volantian hulls are all maintained and created to rigorous standards, including use of reverse-engineered domain-era components, noting a %s increase in supply usage to maintain and uphold the exotic design specifications. However, these demands are often necessary to ensure the enhanced standards to which the hull now performs; this is best seen through a %s increase in flux dissipation and capacity.

However, the ultratech-nature of these vessels severely limits their long-term functionality in extended engagements, decreasing peak performance time by %s.",,graphics/factions/VRI_Crest.png
Volantian Remnant Conversion,volremconversion,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianRemnantConversion,"This ship is a surprisingly well-done hack of a Tri-Tachyon Defense System droneship, featuring (mostly) de-automated subsystems, a life support module, and adaptive weapon mounts, allowing for a ship to host human crew, while also being compliant with the treaty of the First AI War. While the loss of more delicate, high-grade components cuts down maintainance and supply costs by %s and increases peak performance time by %s, even the marvels of Volantian engineering cannot prevent a considerable %s loss in flux capacity and dissipation.",,graphics/factions/VRI_TTDS_Crest.png

Volantian Auxillary,volaux,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianAuxillary,"This ship has been modified to better fit the Volantian aesthetic. Internal, external, and visual changes are mostly superficial.",,graphics/factions/VRI_Aux_Crest.png
Sixth Battlegroup,sixth,,,VI Battlegroup,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.Sixth,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine, particularly exhibited by engineering and subsystem modifications to better fit the doctrine's heavy prioritization of strike craft.

Thanks to certain structural modifications necessitated by the installation of hangar bays, flux dissipation is increased by %s.

However, the energy needed to sustain the high-end fighter autofactories is drawn from engines, decreasing speed by %s.

If a fighter lacks shields, armor damage taken is reduced by %s. When %s fighter overloads, its shield is disabled and it %s overloading.",,graphics/hullmods/sixth.png
