VRI Flux Network,VRI_FluxNetwork,,,VRI,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VRI_FluxNetwork,VRI ships are outfitted with an advanced transponder array which allows them to share fleetwide computational loads. Increases weapon flux efficiency and shield efficiency based on the maximum flux of allied ships deployed with this hullmod. Ships with makeshift networks contribute a lower proportion of their flux maximum to the bonus.,,graphics/hullmods/VRI_FluxNetwork.png
Makeshift VRI Flux Network,VRI_MakeshiftFluxNetwork,,,VRI,,,10000,,,,10,20,30,40,data.hullmods.VRI_MakeshiftFluxNetwork,A makeshift version of the VRI transponder array which allows them to share fleetwide computational loads. Increases weapon flux efficiency and shield efficiency by a slightly reduced amount based on the maximum flux of allied ships deployed with this hullmod. Contributes a lower proportion of this ship's flux maximum to the bonus.,,graphics/hullmods/VRI_FluxNetwork.png
Volantian Engineering Standards,VES,,,VRI,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.Expeditionary,"Volantian hulls are all maintained and created to rigorous standards. Repurposed AI Remnant hardware and improved electrical and flux grids have increased flux capacity and dissipation by %s. Rigorous maintainence schedules do increase supply consumption by %s, but this ship's performance is greatly improved in and out of combat.",,graphics/factions/VRI_Crest.png
