VRI Flux Network,VRI_FluxNetwork,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VRI_FluxNetwork,"Volantian ships are outfitted with an advanced transponder array which allows them to share fleetwide computational loads. Increases weapon flux efficiency and shield efficiency based on the maximum flux of allied ships deployed with this hullmod. Ships with makeshift networks contribute a lower proportion of their flux maximum to the bonus.

Furthermore, the network has safety interlocks to prevent the damage of internal components and electricity grids caused by the computational and mechanical strain of an abundance of Volantian hulls interlinked by the network. Volantian Officers are specially trained to minimize this effect, and to partially disable the interlocks. Makeshift Flux networks are not affected.",,graphics/hullmods/VRI_FluxNetwork.png
Makeshift VRI Flux Network,VRI_MakeshiftFluxNetwork,,,Volantian,,,10000,,,,5,10,15,20,data.hullmods.VRI_MakeshiftFluxNetwork,A makeshift version of the VRI transponder array which allows them to share fleetwide computational loads. Increases weapon flux efficiency and shield efficiency by a slightly reduced amount based on the maximum flux of allied ships deployed with this hullmod.

Volantian Engineering,VES,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianEngineering,"Volantian hulls are all maintained and created to rigorous standards, noting a %s increase in supply usage. However, Volantian ship hulls perform noticably better in combat than their baseline counterparts, featuring %s better handling, as well as %s increased flux dissipation and capacity. Lastly, the presence of repurposed AI Remnant hardware increases the Peak Performance time by %s.",,graphics/factions/VRI_Crest.png
Autoforge Overclocking,autoforgeoverclocking,,,Common,,,10000,,,,10,15,30,45,data.hullmods.AutoforgeOverclocking,"Overclocking the fighter autoforges of this ship dramatically increase their performance, allowing the ship to support an extra fighter wing, as well as decreasing replacement times by %s. However, the significant strain placed upon the ship's power grid decreases flux capacity and dissipation by %s, as well as reducing the shield arc by %s and efficency by %s.",,graphics/hullmods/high_volition_attractor.png
Volantian Remnant Conversion,volremconversion,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianRemnantConversion,"This ship is a surprisingly well-done hack of a Tri-Tachyon Defense System droneship, featuring (mostly) de-automated subsystems, a life support module, and adaptive weapon mounts, allowing for a ship to host human crew, while also being compliant with the treaty of the First AI War. Volantian Engineering has offset the effects of the loss of internal combat-dedicated components, and thanks to streamlined maintainence practices, supply use is reduced by %s. However, the loss of delicate machinery does increase PPT by %s.",,graphics/factions/VRI_TTDS_Crest.png
Volantian Reclaimers,volreclaimers,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianReclaimers,"Volantian Salvagers, more widely known and popularized as 'Reclaimers' are experts in salvaging, increasing the salvage rating of your fleet by %s per ship.",,graphics/hullmods/vol_reclaimers.png
Volantian Auxillary,volaux,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianAuxillary,"This ship has been modified to better fit the Volantian aesthetic. Internal, external, and visual changes are mostly superficial.",,graphics/factions/VRI_Aux_Crest.png
Sixth Battlegroup,sixth,,,VI Battlegroup,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.Sixth,"This ship is a survivor of the original 6th Domain Battlegroup, which left the Persean Sector just before the gate collapse. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""Steel Wings"" doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical structural modifications (performed with pre-Collapse industrial methods) which sees a %s increase in speed and maneuverability. Exceptionally well-tuned energy systems increase flux throughput and capacity by %s over standard examples of this hull. Furthermore, the armor rating sees a flat increase of %s.",,graphics/hullmods/sixth.png
