Azorian Matrices,azorian_matrices,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.AzorianMatrices,"This hull's internal machinery and design are built around an integral network of Azorian crystals, which allow for superluminal communication- through a solid conduit of the crystal, or highly advanced, short-range emitters. This exponential decrease of processing delay allows for incredibly precise, real-time measurements and information.

All modifiers to %s are also applied to %s.

The %s is applied to %s.",,graphics/hullmods/azorian_matrix.png
Volantian Engineering,VES,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianEngineering,"Volantian hulls are all maintained and created to rigorous standards, including use of reverse-engineered domain-era components, noting a %s increase in supply usage to maintain and uphold the exotic design specifications. However, these demands are often necessary to ensure the enhanced standards to which the hull now performs; this is best seen through a %s increase in flux dissipation and capacity.

However, the ultratech-nature of these vessels severely limits their long-term functionality in extended engagements, decreasing peak performance time by %s.",,graphics/factions/VRI_Crest.png
Volantian Remnant Conversion,volremconversion,,,Volantian,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.VolantianRemnantConversion,"This ship is a surprisingly well-done hack of a Tri-Tachyon Defense System droneship, featuring (mostly) de-automated subsystems, a life support module, and adaptive weapon mounts, allowing for a ship to host human crew, while also being compliant with the treaty of the First AI War. While the loss of more delicate, high-grade components cuts down maintainance and supply costs by %s and increases peak performance time by %s, even the marvels of Volantian engineering cannot prevent a considerable %s loss in flux capacity and dissipation.",,graphics/factions/VRI_TTDS_Crest.png

Azorian Shield Tuning,azorian_shields,,,Volantian,,,10000,,,,5,10,20,30,data.hullmods.AzorianShieldTuning,"Integrating Azorian crystals into the external shield emitter nodes creates a unique form of instability which frequently discharges excess energy in the form of electromagnetic arcs, which assist in point-defense measures, at the cost of %s worse shield efficency.",,graphics/hullmods/azorian_shield.png
