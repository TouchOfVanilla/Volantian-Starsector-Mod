Starting with there obsession with the 'temporal shell' ship system, this powerful man decided the only way forward for the Volantian Reclamation Initiative was to focus Immense resources into creating ships armed with this powerful ship system. Ultimately, this would lead to his organization becoming completely bankrupt, with nothing to show for it.
