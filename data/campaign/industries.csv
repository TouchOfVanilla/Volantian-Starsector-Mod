Planetwide distribution of VolGen clinics and production centers enables the general population access to the latest and greatest Volgen cybernetic implants and genetic engineering, allowing the population to adapt to their environment, express individualism, and alter their bodies for military, industrial, personal, and recreational uses. Requires a steady stream of organics, metals, and heavy machinery to operate at optimal capacity.",500
VRI_Artillery,Aegis Artillery Network,40,160,,8,,,"structure, unraidable, military",,graphics/icons/industry/aegis.png,data.world.industries_and_buildings.VRI_Artillery_script,"A planetary net of high-powered railguns, sensor arrays, and orbital telemetry buoys that form the Aegis Orbital Defense Network. It was initally created for the sole purpose of defending Geir's Slab from celestial impacts. Paranoia coupled with superior engineering and redundant failsafes ensures that the network can never be disabled by raiding action or orbital bombardment, as doing so would likely result in catastrophic consequences for the population, biosphere, and the painstakingly terraformed climate of it's planet of origin. Orbital telemetry bouys, joint-targeting algorithms, and a near-endless stockpile of durasteel-composite shells allows the Aegis network to easily intercept incoming asteroids and meteors before they impact on the planet. The network of railguns also doubles as orbital artillery against hostile fleets in-system, aiding in planetary defense efforts.",500
