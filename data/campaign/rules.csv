$faction.id == vri score 10",ShowImageVisual space_bar,"Bars on Volantis have been deemed ""redundant; the gravity makes you lightheaded enough,"" to use one local's phrase. Yet here one is, tucked into a corner between a VolGen genetics clinic and a Volantian Armed Forces recruitment office, of all things. The bar itself is lavish, the nice decor and complimentary snacks showing a level of trust in patrons that you find jarring. As you would expect from the placement, the patrons resemble the usual cluster of ensigns drowning their sorrows you would find on any Hegemony world, their tails draped over the barstools- yet many seem to be drinking non-alcoholic beverages. Perhaps that local wasn't exaggerating after all. An ad-holo projected onto the wall behind the bartender features a lineup of individuals with highly diverse and exotic modifications, reading ‘Be yourself with VolGen’",,
bartext_Geir,BarPrintDesc,"$id == vri_planet_Geir score 9999999
$faction.id == vri score 10",ShowImageVisual space_bar,"The bar in the port concourse of Geir’s slab is quite an old one- It’s still run out of an old prefab colony building from before the planet had a proper atmosphere. The old life support module provides dry, crisp air and warmth from the chilling walk here. Many patrons come here out of pure necessity, relying on the vast array of spirits to warm their veins for whatever their next stop may be. You see countless ad-holos for thermal nanodermis installations and scantily clad models sporting fluffy, white tails, with text reading ""Stay warm with VolGen.""",,
bartext_Nocturne,BarPrintDesc,"$id == vri_nocturne score 9999999
$faction.id == vri score 10",ShowImageVisual space_bar,"Bars on Nocturne station are often filled with cadets, officers, admirals, and just about every person that wears the VAF insignia on their uniform. As you walk into one, you’re immediately assaulted by the overwhelming amount of noise from inside- much like military bars across the sector, they’re never a dull place. You see an ad-holo featuring a VAF soldier in teal fatigues, standing at attention. The banner reads “Reclaim your place in the sector; Join the VAF today!”",,
bartext_SubA1,BarPrintDesc,"$id == vri_planet_suba1 score 9999999
$faction.id == vri score 10",ShowImageVisual space_bar,"SPA1 has a bar on practically every single one of it’s 42 levels; the digital map and navigation software you were provided after receiving docking clearance guides you away from the gentle humming of the volatile extraction and processing facilities and towards a bar filled with captains, officers, and their assistants, mostly clad in the VAF teal.

The cool and crisp oxygen-scrubbed atmosphere reminiscent of a starship bridge gives you the feeling that this bar is specially tailored for captains, and you weren’t led here by accident.

You feel as if you’ll have plenty in common with the patrons of this bar- not from a physical perspective, you remind yourself.",,
bartext_Desmond,BarPrintDesc,"$id == vri_planet_Desmond score 9999999
$faction.id == vri score 10",ShowImageVisual space_bar,"The port concourses of Desmond’s Landing are much higher in the planet’s crust compared to the rest of the subterranean infrastructure. As a result, the bar you find yourself in is mostly populated by the errant starship captain, rowdy crews, and upper-crust laborers, spending their hazard pay on the assortment of fine, imported liquors from Volantis. You spot an Ad-Holo above the bar, featuring a close-up facial shot of a miner in a hardsuit shrouded in darkness, with their eyes illuminated through their visor with brilliant, vivid colors. The caption reads “See the way forward with VolGen”",,
bartext_Stalos,BarPrintDesc,"$id == vri_Stalos score 9999999
$faction.id == vri score 10",ShowImageVisual space_bar,"The few bars on Stalos Outpost are usually filled with VSB employees unwinding after weeks or sometimes months of frontier salvaging voyages. You find a proper-looking establishment that has perfectly recreated an old Volantian Empire-style bar. A plaque mounted above the bar thanks ‘Captain Forger’ for all of the furniture and decor that gives this bar such an antique flavor. An ad-holo projected from the ceiling features a VSB employee in zero-g, working on a salvage operation. A grappling hook shot from their forearm dominates the central focus of the image as it attaches to a valuable-looking crate of goodies. The caption reads “Seize your destiny with VolGen.”",,
bartext_VRI,BarPrintDesc,$faction.id == vri score 10,ShowImageVisual space_bar,"Volantian Bars are often filled with junior officers, soldiers on shore leave, and transient starship captains, much like yourself. There’s no shortage of liquor to be had, and no shortage of people who enjoy it. An ad-holo for VolGen features graphics and media that you suspect the making of which isn’t exactly compliant with the treaty of Crom Cruach.",,
