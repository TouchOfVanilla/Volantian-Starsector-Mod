Yet here one is, tucked into a corner between a VolGen genetics clinic and a Volantian Armed Forces recruitment office, of all things. The bar itself is lavish, the nice decor and complimentary snacks showing a level of trust in patrons that you find jarring. As you would expect from the placement, the patrons resemble the usual cluster of ensigns drowning their sorrows you would find on any Hegemony world, their tails draped over the barstools- yet many seem to be drinking non-alcoholic beverages. Perhaps that local wasn't exaggerating after all. An ad-holo projected onto the wall behind the bartender features a lineup of individuals with highly diverse and exotic modifications, reading ‘Be yourself with VolGen’",,

The old life support module provides dry, crisp air and warmth from the chilling walk here. Many patrons come here out of pure necessity, relying on the vast array of spirits to warm their veins for whatever their next stop may be. You see countless ad-holos for thermal nanodermis installations and scantily clad models sporting fluffy, white tails, with text reading ""Stay warm with VolGen.""",,
bartext_Nocturne,BarPrintDesc,"$id == vri_nocturne score 9999999

As you walk into one, you’re immediately assaulted by the overwhelming amount of noise from inside- much like military bars across the sector, they’re never a dull place. You see an ad-holo featuring a VAF soldier in teal fatigues, standing at attention. The banner reads “Reclaim your place in the sector; Join the VAF today!”",,

The cool and crisp oxygen-scrubbed atmosphere reminiscent of a starship bridge gives you the feeling that this bar is specially tailored for captains, and you weren’t led here by accident.

You feel as if you’ll have plenty in common with the patrons of this bar- not from a physical perspective, you remind yourself.",,

As a result, the bar you find yourself in is mostly populated by the errant starship captain, rowdy crews, and upper-crust laborers, spending their hazard pay on the assortment of fine, imported liquors from Volantis. You spot an Ad-Holo above the bar, featuring a close-up facial shot of a miner in a hardsuit shrouded in darkness, with their eyes illuminated through their visor with brilliant, vivid colors. The caption reads “See the way forward with VolGen”",,

You find a proper-looking establishment that has perfectly recreated an old Volantian Empire-style bar. A plaque mounted above the bar thanks ‘Captain Forger’ for all of the furniture and decor that gives this bar such an antique flavor. An ad-holo projected from the ceiling features a VSB employee in zero-g, working on a salvage operation. A grappling hook shot from their forearm dominates the central focus of the image as it attaches to a valuable-looking crate of goodies. The caption reads “Seize your destiny with VolGen.”",,
