I was ready to leave this god-awful backwater sector. Five cycles of nothing but opportunistic pirates, fanatic luddites, and rebels. I swear, the moment that your average spacer thinks nobody's looking, he runs to the nearest flag that isn't the Domain's. Of course, if they didn't, this fleet wouldn't have a job to do, but I digress.

Orders came in directly from command on the usual biweekly packet ship, and told us that we'd be staying behind to put down one last rebellion. Supposedly, the 130th Legion is the closest to deal with it, so it looks like we're going to be late for the party with the rest of the battlegroup. Command also told us that the 14th was en route, and should we run into any difficulties, they'll back us up. I'm not too worried about it- the crew is already getting fired up for the chance at a real fight.

Well, who am I to deny them?
